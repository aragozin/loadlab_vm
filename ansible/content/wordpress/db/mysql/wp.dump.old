This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote></figure>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"The Month in WordPress: March 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2019/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:59:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:368:\"WordPress reached a significant milestone this month.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\">PHP 5.6 is going to become the minimum required PHP version for WordPress</a>, a significant step towards a more modern web and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">updated coding standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-2-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in beta</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>).

She is conducting a <a href=\"http://nevena.blog/2019/04/27/open-source-survey-the-future-of-wordpress-careers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> for professionals that is open to anyone working in a WordPress-related capacity, including writers, developers, marketers, UI &#038; UX designers, illustrators, community drivers, evangelists, project managers, and creatives.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://nevena.blog/2019/04/27/open-source-survey-the-future-of-wordpress-careers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> takes less than five minutes to complete and the results will be shared at WordCamp Europe in Berlin and on <a href=\"http://nevena.blo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nevena.blog</a>. Tomovoic will be giving a presentation titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/renaissance-jobs-in-wordpress-skills-you-need-to-survive-the-21st-century-career/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Renaissance jobs in WordPress: Skills you need to survive the 21st-century career</a>,&#8221; where she will elaborate on global trends related to the job landscape.

You might have come across roles such as experience architect, user experience consultant, or even customer wrangler, all of these typically involve technical knowledge, excellent communication and management skills. All of these roles are a completely foreign concept for most of our parents. The 21st century has brought with it remote work, chief growth officers, and a globalized workforce among other things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tomovic&#8217;s survey data will identify what skills are most important in the WordPress job market right now. The survey does not collect any personal data and the raw data will be deleted after the results are published. </p>\n<p>If you want to check out Tomovic&#8217;s talk in person, make sure to <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">purchase a ticket</a> to WordCamp Europe.

The plugin now enables fewer features on setup so users can have more control over what they activate on their sites.  </p>\n<p>The new version also integrates with WordPress 5.2&#8217;s new Site Health checks. It includes a status check and moves Jetpack&#8217;s legacy debug data to a section in the new &#8220;Site Health Info&#8221; tab. The initial status check isn&#8217;t very descriptive regarding critical errors, but these error messages can be improved in future iterations so users know how to get to a page with more information. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-11.57.44-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>New Membership Block Now Available for Jetpack Beta Testers</h3>\n<p>Jetpack is getting ready to introduce a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/9802\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Membership block</a> that will essentially function like a recurring donation button using Stripe as the payment gateway. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jetpack-membership-button.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Users will be able to set the currency, price, product name, and renewal interval directly within the block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-block-configure.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds the new block behind the JETPACK_BETA_BLOCKS constant for users who are beta testing new blocks. Feedback from testers will be addressed in future pull requests. The PR merged into Jetpack 7.3 includes the following technical additions for the new Membership block:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce endpoints that communicate with WP.COM</li>\n<li>Whitelist certain options, CPTs and meta to store / sync data</li>\n<li>Introduce Gutenberg block that uses these endpoints and provides UI to connect to Stripe, create and choose a product</li>\n<li>Introduce a frontend of a block with the sole purpose of displaying a checkout window from WP.com in an iframe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In its current form, the use of the term &#8220;Membership&#8221; for the block might be a bit misleading for some users, depending on their expectations. Site owners usually expect more granular management of members, multiple membership tiers, customizable emails, various renewal options, content access, and more for managing memberships. </p>\n<p>Unless Jetpack intends to make this the gateway to more robust membership capabilities, then &#8220;Recurring donation/payment button&#8221; might be a more accurate name for the block. However, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see a more full-featured Membership module turn up as a SaaS product from WordPress.com, as opposed to everything getting packed into the plugin.</p>\n<p>No release date has been announced for the membership block as it is still under active development and in the very early stages of beta testing.</p>\n<p>Check out the full <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a> to see all the enhancements and bug fixes in Jetpack 7.3.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 May 2019 17:57:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 “Jaco” Released, Includes Fatal PHP Error Protection and A Recovery Mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89405\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-jaco-released-includes-fatal-php-error-protection-and-a-recovery-mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4870:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 &#8220;Jaco&#8221; named after bassist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius\">Jaco Pastorius</a>, is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/jaco/\">now available for download</a>. Normally, I&#8217;d start listing new features but I&#8217;m going to do something a little different this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin by recognizing the 327 people who contributed to this release with 109 of those being first time contributors. It was led by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pento.net/\">Gary Pendergast</a>. Included in the list is Alex (Viper007Bond) Mills who <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/alex-mills-ends-his-battle-with-leukemia\">passed away</a> from Leukemia earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Screenshot taken by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kraft/status/1125892606913855489\">Brandon Kraft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mills still has a few uncommitted patches in Trac so it&#8217;s possible he&#8217;ll end up on the list of contributors in future releases. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Minimum PHP Version Required to Run WordPress 5.2 Is Now 5.6.20</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 bumps up the minimum PHP version required to 5.6.20. If you&#8217;re using an older version, you&#8217;ll need to update PHP before upgrading to WordPress 5.2. Updating PHP to version 7.3 or above <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\">is recommended</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Additional Improvements to Site Health Check </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-1-improves-editor-performance-encourages-users-to-update-outdated-php-versions\">WordPress 5.1</a>, Site Health Check features were added to inform users of outdated PHP versions. WordPress 5.2 builds on this foundation by adding two new pages that help debug common configuration issues. Users can find the Site Health section in the WordPress backend by browsing to <strong>Tools &gt; Site Health</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Site Health Check Test Results</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsing to the Site Health page triggers a series of tests. When the tests are performed, errors and recommended improvements are displayed on the  results page. There&#8217;s also a an Information tab that displays every detail about the configuration of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Site Health Check Detailed Information</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and Plugin authors can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/25/site-health-check-in-5-2/\">add their own tests</a> and modify or remove existing ones with filters. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fatal Error Protection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of seeing the dreaded &#8220;white screen of death,&#8221; WordPress 5.2 includes fatal PHP error protection. When a fatal error is detected, a user-facing error message is displayed and an email is sent to the administrator&#8217;s email address. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The email includes a link to a new feature called &#8220;recovery mode.&#8221; While in recovery mode, plugins and themes that are causing fatal errors are put into a paused state to ensure administrators can work around the errors and access the backend normally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being informed about which themes or plugins are causing fatal errors, administrators have at least three options to fix the issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Administrators can deactivate the theme or plugin to maintain a working version of the site.</li><li>Administrators can fix the problem if they have the technical capabilities, and afterwards reactivate the theme or plugin.</li><li>Administrators can file a support request with the developer, pointing out the error.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Administrators can exit recovery mode by pressing a button in the admin bar. A few examples on how developers can utilize this feature can be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">found here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 also includes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">accessibility improvements</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\">thirteen new dashboard icons</a>, plugin compatibility checks, and an variety of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-3rd-april/\">changes to the block editor</a>. In addition, the Privacy Policy page includes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">four new helpers</a> that make customizing and designing the page easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the features in WordPress 5.2 and how to extend or work with them, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/wordpress-5-2-field-guide/\">WordPress 5.2 Field Guide</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 May 2019 17:16:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"HeroPress: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2805\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:154:\"https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12270:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050819-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I was scared that if I failed to learn what I need to know, I\'d be left in the dust.\" /><p>I’ve been a web designer since 1996. In some ways, it’s hard for me to fathom. Those were the days of Netscape Navigator and table-based page layouts. I wrote every bit of HTML by hand on a seriously-underpowered computer and a tiny monitor. Definitely a far cry from where we are today.</p>\n<p>I was completely self-taught and learned by doing. When I landed my first job as a full-time “webmaster” at my <a href=\"https://cumberlink.com/\">local newspaper</a>, I didn’t even know what Photoshop was (I had been using Microsoft Paint for graphics – feel free to laugh).</p>\n<p>Looking back, I know that I wasn’t a very good designer in those days – but that didn’t matter. I felt lucky to be on the ground floor of an industry that was poised to change the world.</p>\n<h3>An Early Start</h3>\n<p>As an 18-year-old, I was often the youngest person in the office. Sometimes, that led to not being taken seriously by those in charge. Still, I did have a few mentors at the paper who were more than generous with their friendship and advice. It was my first taste of the “real world” – a lesson I sorely needed.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I realized that I wasn’t going to stay there forever. The pay wasn’t very good and the hours weren’t my cup of tea. Most of all, I just felt that I could do better. Just over a year in, I left.</p>\n<p>From there, I spent the next couple of years in various corporate settings – none of which felt very fulfilling. My existence was very much that of a worker bee. Sure, this is what happens when you’re just starting out – but I was too dense to see it that way.</p>\n<p>Again, I had a feeling that there was something else out there for me. But there didn’t seem to be a path to further my career, unless I took it upon myself to do so.</p>\n<p>So, in 1999 I went all-in as a freelancer working from home. While I’ve gone through a few different places to call home in the years since, I’m still here – thanks in great part to WordPress.</p>\n<p>But before I found both the software and community that would change my trajectory, I had to go through some ups and downs.</p>\n<h3>Hitting a Wall</h3>\n<p>Starting my own business at 21 was at once frightening and gratifying. I booked a few steady clients early on, and that provided a much-needed boost in confidence (and revenue). Yet there was also a tremendous amount of responsibility that I wasn’t prepared for. It was another real-world lesson and I had to mature in a hurry.</p>\n<p>As for technology, I upgraded my computer, but not necessarily my approach. The first several years were still ruled by building static HTML sites. And as clients started asking for more complex features such as ecommerce, I realized something about myself: I was incredibly afraid of what I didn’t know.</p>\n<p>This feeling would haunt me much more than I could have anticipated. It was like a massive weight on my shoulders. As long as work kept me in my comfort zone, I was fine. But anything outside of that brought out my anxiety.</p>\n<p>Sure, I had achieved some level of success at a young age (with a hobby site even going <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_(drink)#Revival\">viral</a>). I had plenty of work, I even moved out of my parent’s house. But I also feared the unknown. I hadn’t been a very good student in high school and had zero confidence in my ability to learn something more advanced.</p>\n<p>At the same time, that fear was joined by a great deal of frustration. I started struggling to build larger sites using those same tired methods. And maintaining them was even worse.</p>\n<p>In all, I was stressed out and felt stuck in a dead end. The passion I once had for design and code had vanished. I was in desperate need of a new direction.</p>\n<h3>A Glimmer of Light</h3>\n<p>It’s amazing how, just when things feel their darkest, a little bit of light shows up and sparks something in you. For me, WordPress was like a tiny matchstick in a pitch-black cave.</p>\n<p>Somewhere around 2005, I installed an early version of WordPress as a playful experiment. At the time, I saw other content management systems starting to pop up, but wasn’t really impressed. Frankly, the sites running them all looked the same.</p>\n<p>But tearing apart a WordPress theme was different. I knew nothing about PHP, but found that the templates were pretty easy to follow. I liked that I could make design changes without too much trouble. Even if I broke something, I was (usually) able to bring things back to their previous state.</p>\n<p>Still, I wasn’t ready or willing to abandon my old-school techniques for building sites just yet (I even jettisoned the CSS layouts from my theme and replaced them with tables). WordPress was something I used on the periphery. I created a few simple blogs for clients, but hadn’t really thought of using it for anything more.</p>\n<p>In fact, it would be a few more years until I was finally ready to make a change.</p>\n<h3>A New Beginning</h3>\n<p>2010 was a banner year in my career. It was the year where I, inspired by my wife and newborn daughter, started to really confront my fears. I had grown completely tired of the way I had been doing things. This was the year I became convinced that WordPress was the game-changer I needed.</p>\n<p>As the software matured, more developers started using it to run entire sites – not just traditional blogs. I was very much intrigued, even excited, about the possibility of what I could achieve in terms of both design and functionality.</p>\n<p>So, I convinced one of my agency clients to let me try using WordPress on a project. Things went well enough that we decided to start using it more often. And, for me, it was like that little matchstick in the dark cave turned into a huge beacon.</p>\n<p>The more I used WordPress, the more curious I became about what else it could do. I found myself not only being unafraid to learn, but actually <em>motivated</em> to do so.</p>\n<p>By the next year, I had moved almost exclusively to WordPress. That led to another watershed moment: Attending my first WordCamp.</p>\n<h3>Discovering That I Wasn&#8217;t Alone</h3>\n<p>Visiting <a href=\"https://2011.philly.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp Philadelphia 2011</a> was an eye-opening experience. This was not the buttoned-down, corporate atmosphere that brought me discomfort years earlier. Instead, I found a casual, welcoming vibe that made me feel like I belonged.</p>\n<p>The crowd was diverse in just about every way imaginable. And I met people who were all over the map when it came to knowledge of WordPress. Some were complete newbies, others were experts. But regardless of their skill level or experience, they all gathered in the same place. It struck me that I was now a part of something unique.</p>\n<p>This burgeoning community, coupled with great software, had all of the sudden put me on a path that I never imagined possible. It made me want to learn all that I could and be a part of something bigger than myself.</p>\n<p>Before too long, I discovered a confidence I never felt before. I was not only building better websites than I ever had, I was also eager to be a part of the WordPress community. And, despite being a bit shy, I even spoke at WordCamp Baltimore in <a href=\"https://2012.baltimore.wordcamp.org/speakers/#eric-karkovack\">2012</a>.</p>\n<p>I felt like anything was possible.</p>\n<h3>Opportunity Knocks</h3>\n<p>As my experience with both WordPress and its community has grown, it has opened up some amazing opportunities. For one, it gave me the courage to try and fulfill another lifelong dream: to become a writer.</p>\n<p>I started off by submitting an article to <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/how-to-deal-with-creative-differences-with-clients/\">Speckyboy Web Design Magazine</a>, not really knowing what to expect. When it was published, I was incredibly excited. So, I kept on writing. And each time, site editor Paul Andrew kept on publishing my work.</p>\n<p>Even more mind-boggling is that, eventually, this led to a regular <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/author/erickarkovack/\">role</a> with the site. I’ve published hundreds of articles and have enjoyed every minute of it. And more writing gigs have followed. My topic of choice? WordPress, of course!</p>\n<p>When it comes to my design business, I’m no longer afraid to push those boundaries. I’ve built and maintained hundreds of WordPress sites that run the gamut in terms of size and functionality. Yes, including the formerly fear-inducing ecommerce.</p>\n<p>But I know that, without the confidence boost I received by working with WordPress, none of this would have been possible. I am beyond grateful, and so glad that I found it at a pivotal time in my life.</p>\n<h3>What I&#8217;ve Learned</h3>\n<p>So, what does this all mean? I’ve given it a lot of thought.</p>\n<p>There are still days when I’m overwhelmed and stressed out. But even then, I tell myself how I lucky I am to do what I do each day. And somehow, I have maintained a passion for my work that I think is here to stay.</p>\n<p>But the biggest lesson I’ve learned, and the thing I’d like to share with you, is to give yourself a chance to learn and grow. Sometimes, the unknown can be scary – I get it. I was so afraid of the fact that I wasn’t formally trained and that I didn’t have the knowledge I needed to go further. I was scared that if I failed to learn what I needed to know that I’d be left in the dust.</p>\n<p>Yet, that’s the amazing thing about WordPress and web design in general. There are so many great resources out there you can learn from. And there is a community out there who is willing to help and share what they know.</p>\n<p>Everything is right there in front of us. All it takes is a willingness to try.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Broadening%20My%20Horizons%20Through%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbroadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbroadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbroadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress%2F&title=Broadening+My+Horizons+Through+WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050819-min-150x150.jpg&description=Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/\" title=\"Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/\">Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 May 2019 12:00:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Eric Karkovack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 “Jaco”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6925\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/jaco/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28370:\"<h2>Keeping Sites Safer</h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/05/about_maintain-wordpress-cropped.png?fit=632%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6926\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 5.2 of WordPress, named “Jaco” in honor of renowned and revolutionary jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard.

Not doing a review doesn’t mean that you’ll lose your privileges or that you’ll have to re-apply. You’ll just not be able to have your themes set live until you finish a review.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Trusted Authors program was put in place a year ago with the goal of streamlining the review process for authors who consistently produce high quality code in line with the current guidelines. The idea was to relieve some of the burden for theme reviewers and reduce the queue. </p>\n<p>Trusted Authors are required to do a full review of a parent theme (no child themes permitted). Themes that are not approved will not count. After performing the review, the author may then upload a theme and add a comment to it with a link to their latest review that meets the requirement.</p>\n<p>The change to the program is controversial, based on the feedback from other members of the Theme Review team who commented on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand the reason behind it, but I cannot agree with it,&#8221; WordPress theme author <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/ilovewpcom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dumitru Brinzan</a> said. &#8220;Reviews should be done out of professional desire, not to buy a credit for setting a theme live quicker.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This might reduce the quality of reviews, because trusted authors are now directly interested in setting more themes live. This means that someone will have to monitor more closely the reviews done by trusted authors. This just feels unnatural somehow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Justin Tadlock, a long-time review team member who volunteered as a lead for many years, said he is disappointed to see this idea resurface after he and others shot it down multiple times in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I assume the team got permission from higher up the chain to run a pay-for-play system,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;We’ve already <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/04/18/theme-review-incentive-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">established they are not allowed</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What such systems do is provide an unfair advantage to larger theme businesses with multiple employees. They assign one of their employees to handle a review and keep pumping out themes without missing a beat. All the while, solo developers are forced into &#8216;volunteering&#8217; with time they may not even have. Not that it’s fair to businesses either; it’s just worse on solo devs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also said that based on his experience with past incentives, forcing Trusted Authors to join the review team in order reap the benefits of the program will likely result in a decline in the quality of the reviews.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making people contribute to the review system should absolutely never happen in any shape or form,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It should never be the means in which the team shows favoritism to one author/team over another.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And, when you tie incentive programs to the review system, you tend to get shit reviews. We’ve already seen this happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock referenced the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/04/18/theme-review-incentive-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Incentive program</a> that was implemented in 2014 which became highly controversial due to a number of underlying problems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically, that program allowed the top reviewers to select the featured themes every month,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;The original idea (at least from my understanding) would be that they&#8217;d select featured themes from the list of themes that they&#8217;d reviewed.  Instead, they chose their own themes, month after month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What ended up happening is that many of those top reviewers would just burn through reviews, focusing on number rather than quality.  Bad, sometimes insecure, code would fall through the cracks.  Some themes really didn&#8217;t even get anywhere near a proper review.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to Tadlock referencing the past incentive program, Cosmin pointed out several differences with the new Trusted Author requirement to join the review team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last time we did this it was a competition for the Featured page (which in my opinion is of higher value than having a theme on Latest),&#8221; Cosmin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/#comment-43743\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Back then you also had to do a lot of reviews just to get the chance of selecting a featured theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With TAs you don’t lose anything, you either do or not the review, you keep your TA status. One review a month is just 15-30 minutes of reviewing. Either way they are still ‘pumping out themes without missing a beat.’ Any TA author that has time to pump out 3-4 themes a month also has time to do a freaking review.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Theme Review Team Leadership Did Not Consult the Team Before Implementing Changes to Trusted Authors Program</h3>\n<p>This change to the Trusted Authors Program seems to have blindsided other members of the Theme Review Team who only learned of it from the announcement today. The idea was not discussed publicly in the #themereview channel on Slack. It was a unilateral decision made by the leadership behind closed doors. </p>\n<p>I asked Cosmin for background on the decision and he said it was discussed in a private meeting of Theme Review Team leads that included William Patton and Ganga Kafle. He said the decision just happened while they were discussing the current state of the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/report/2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">queue</a> and how things are not going well. </p>\n<p>There are 120 themes waiting to be reviewed and Cosmin estimated that authors are waiting approximately two months in order to get their themes approved. He said the changes to the Trusted Authors program are &#8220;currently the only viable option with short term results.&#8221; </p>\n<p>However, Tadlock is concerned that Trusted Authors who didn&#8217;t have the desire to review themes prior to the requirement might simply do the minimum possible to stay in the program. It also sets a precedent for requiring volunteer time in order to receive the benefit of a streamlined review.</p>\n<p>This particular controversy is another milestone in the Theme Review Team&#8217;s perennial struggle with an unmanageable queue. In the past, the team has entertained suggestions about relaxing the submission guidelines and limiting reviews to security concerns, but changes in this direction never seem to materialize. So far the team has had success with limiting authors to submitting one theme at a time. It slows the growth of the directory but makes the work more manageable for the volunteers who often find themselves knee-deep in manual code review without an end in sight.</p>\n<p>The new requirement for Trusted Authors to perform reviews in order to have their themes set live may still be up for discussion if other reviewers continue to raise concerns, but comments from the leads indicate that they want to give it a try before scrapping the idea. In response to Tadlock&#8217;s concern about the potential impact on the quality of reviews, Cosmin said the leadership will decide based on how the program goes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s expected that TAs are experienced authors that know the requirements,&#8221; Cosmin said. &#8220;We’ll monitor this and if it’s the other way around, we’ll decide then. We get shit reviews right now without having any incentives.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 07 May 2019 19:15:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Tabor Theme Now Available as a Free Gatsby Theme for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89336\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/tabor-theme-now-available-as-a-free-gatsby-theme-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2407:\"<p><a href=\"https://gatsbywpthemes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby WordPress Themes</a>, a project launched earlier this year by a group of collaborators, has just released its second free theme.

After installing a few plugins, top-level menu items begin to pile on. This adds even more complexity to grapple with in a narrow space with long lists of items hidden behind flyout menus that make managing WordPress on mobile a frustrating experience. </p>\n<p>The admin dashboard design hasn&#8217;t changed significantly since the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MP6 plugin</a> was merged into <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 3.8</a> in 2013. This project brought updated typography and improved contrast to the admin but didn&#8217;t tackle the increasing complexity of admin navigation. </p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47012\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal on trac</a> aims to simplify the left sidebar navigation to improve accessibility, usability, and scalability by replacing the flyouts with accordion menus. Designer <a href=\"https://davemart.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Martin</a> shared some mockups originally created by <a href=\"https://joen.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joen Asmussen</a>, and describes them as &#8220;a very early, exploratory concept.&#8221; </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-06-at-11.32.11-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Martin listed several reasons for exploring a new design, including the inaccessibility of the hover/flyout menus and how poorly they scale on mobile interfaces. He also cited the abundance of top-level menu items that are rarely used, which he said contributes to the cognitive weight of admin navigation by still being permanently visible.</p>\n<p>The major changes included in this proposal include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flyout menus are replaced with accordion behavior. This scales all the way from mobile to desktop, and affords better accessibility.</li>\n<li>Menu is made 80px wider (240px vs. 160), affording a 14px minimum font size for all items, perhaps bigger icons in the future, more relaxed spacing, enhancing usability and accessibility.</li>\n<li>Sidebar is grouped in major sections, “Site”, “Design”, “Tools” and “Manage”.</li>\n<li>“Updates” are moved to a subsection of “Manage”, making Home a single item.</li>\n<li>Items related to content on your site (such as “Posts” and “Pages”) are moved under “Site”.</li>\n<li>Clicking major menu items just opens or closes the accordion, as opposed to go directly to the first subsection. This unifies the mobile and desktop behavior. You can keep the accordion open if you use it all the time (each click will save state, so you’ll see the same open/closed sections upon page refresh).</li>\n<li>All “Settings” subsections are moved under “Manage”, along with “Plugins &#038; Blocks” and “Users”.</li>\n<li>Separators group major categories, like “Site” and “Design” together</li>\n<li>Dashboard is renamed “Home”, because all of WordPress is a Dashboard, and “Home” is where you can get an overview at a glance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress core committer John Blackbourn commented on the proposal, recommending further exploration of what the menu could look like for different user roles and whether that might affect the appearance, grouping, and behavior of the menu items. For example, roles with more limited publishing capabilities, such as a subscriber, would see very few menu items. </p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a bit of discussion regarding the use of the word &#8216;Site&#8217; where some might better understand that section as &#8216;Content.&#8217; As this is just an initial mockup, nothing is set in stone and many iterations will likely follow.</p>\n<p>Even with many changes expected as the concept evolves, the proposed design significantly reduces cognitive load, especially for new users who may not be as familiar with the admin menu. An updated admin navigation design might lend itself well to being tested as a feature plugin. As with any major change in WordPress, there are many considerations for how it will affect plugin developers. Major visual overhauls like this are exciting, but it takes time to get it right. This proposal already shows a lot of promise but needs more feedback and participation from diverse user groups across the WordPress community. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 06 May 2019 20:20:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Plugin for OctoberCMS Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89297\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-for-octobercms-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2833:\"<p>Last week we reported on <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg, a Gutenberg implementation for Laravel</a> that is now in beta.

OctobeCMS was launched in 2015, and still captures only a tiny sliver of the CMS market share, but it is growing in popularity among the top one million websites, according to stats from <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/October-CMS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BuiltWith</a>. The CMS has a growing ecosystem of more than 700 themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg for OctoberCMS</a> plugin is now in beta. It allows developers to embed Gutenberg in the backend via their own model by <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/docs/database/relations#polymorphic-relations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">creating a Polymorphic relation</a>. The plugin integrates Laraberg but all of its blocks are standard from the Gutenberg.js package. It doesn&#8217;t include anything custom. </p>\n<p>Most aspects of Gutenberg are working in the beta, including common blocks, formatting, layout, and embed blocks, custom styles, and block settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gutenberg-october-cms.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>None of WordPress&#8217; standard widgets work in the plugin and Khaetsky said he plans to remove them in future updates.</p>\n<p>Anything that requires media uploading, such as the gallery block, inline images, and cover block, are not working. Khaetsky said he is working on getting the plugin integrated with the native OctoberCMS Medialibrary. He encouraged anyone who wants to contribute to that effort to submit a PR to the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/FlusherDock1/Gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>. </p>\n<p>Khaetsky&#8217;s free plugin is MIT-licensed and available in the official OctoberCMS plugin marketplace.

Carandang created Block Options prior to co-founding CoBlocks, which was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by GoDaddy</a>. It began as a plugin for controlling block visibility, inspired by his <a href=\"https://widget-options.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Widget Options</a> plugin, but has since grown to include more features for managing Gutenberg blocks. EditorsKit now offers the following capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Devices Visibility Options</li>\n<li>User Login State Visibility</li>\n<li>Display Logic</li>\n<li>Advanced Custom Fields Integration</li>\n<li>Block Guide Lines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;As much as I love the name &#8216;Block Options,&#8217; it has started to become too generic and has been used a lot on the Gutenberg editor itself,&#8221; Carandang said. &#8220;So, I have decided to change the name to something that stands out and fits the purpose more – page building block options for the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The name EditorsKit came from &#8216;Editor’s Toolkit.&#8217; I’ve been progressively moving towards building a set of tools that will help users navigate through the editor more conveniently, besides giving them visibility control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 1.4 of the plugin introduces the new Block Guide Lines feature, one of the features to go beyond visibility management. It allows users to toggle guide lines on/off for titles and editor blocks to check element boundaries. Carandang said the feature becomes especially useful when handling nested blocks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The last major release of the plugin also improves the UI and UX with a new “Visibility Settings” modal for managing all visibilities in the same place. The modal includes an &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab for more complicated options that are more likely to be used by developers, such as custom display logic and ACF visibility support.</p>\n<p>Under the umbrella of its new branding and <a href=\"https://editorskit.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, Carandang plans to expand EditorsKit to include more tools, with the next set focused on developers. Next on the roadmap is a setting to toggle Auto Save on/off and theme support for page template body classes.</p>\n<p>Check out a quick preview of the improved interface and new features below:</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 May 2019 20:35:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Post Status: An Interview with Reyes Martínez of Frontity — a new WordPress framework\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=61374\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/frontity-wordpress-framework-reyes-martinez/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9707:\"<p>Previously known as Worona, Madrid-based <a href=\"https://frontity.org/\">Frontity</a> is close to launching their eponymous public beta, <a href=\"https://github.com/frontity/frontity\">described on Github</a> as both &#8220;an alternative rendering engine for WordPress,&#8221; and &#8220;a React framework to create WordPress themes.&#8221; Frontity, the framework, runs separately from WordPress on Node.js and uses the WordPress API to generate HTML and AMP pages. Unlike other approaches to &#8220;headless&#8221; WordPress, Frontity is the first to be built exclusively for WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PS: Can you give us an overview of Frontity&#8217;s history and how your company, product, and brand has developed?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Reyes_final-copy-752x501.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-61434\" />Reyes Martínez</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> It all started back in 2015 when Pablo Postigo and Luis Herranz created Worona, a free WordPress plugin to turn blogs into mobile apps. Pablo and Luis discovered a lot of people were concerned about the way their WordPress sites performed on mobile devices. They thought it would be a  powerful solution to build an open source platform that could be extended by other WordPress developers.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met Pablo and Luis in late 2015, loved their project and joined them. I was used to working with WordPress as a content editor, but I didn’t have a technical background. So I mostly started helping by writing blog posts, social media content, documentation, and providing user support. Now I’m in charge of Frontity’s marketing and communications. (I still don’t code but would love to learn at some point!)<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that first prototype, they decided to develop a free platform not just for creating mobile apps. The idea was that any WordPress user could build mobile apps, progressive web apps, or add Google AMP to their blogs in a very easy way. This was Worona 1.0, which was launched in February of 2017. Thousands of WordPress users joined that journey, and we’re truly thankful for that. At that time we already used React and fetched the blog’s content using WordPress&#8217;s REST API. The mobile apps were created with <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\">Cordova</a>.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Worona had a loyal following, we were aware that mobile app usage was slowly declining. People don’t want to download an app for every blog they read. Plus, Apple stopped supporting apps from app generation platforms like ours. This became a serious problem as we couldn’t grow under that scenario.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when we decided to bet on the mobile web and started working on a new framework for building Progressive Web App themes (based on React) on top of WordPress. In 2018 we rebranded to Frontity and got financial backing to make the project grow. Although our main goal was to keep the code open source, we decided to use it internally and release a product exclusively to WordPress publishers (we called it Frontity PRO), so we could see what happened and gather feedback.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontity PRO is a proprietary mobile theme built on React for WordPress blogs and news sites. It implements Progressive Web App technologies and uses the REST API to fetch the content, along with our WordPress plugin, WordPress<em> </em>PWA.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Frontity PRO was created, we also contributed to the official WCEU PWA. Building a PWA from the ground up is a difficult and time-consuming task, but we had created a framework to precisely solve that problem. It was the perfect time to test it out and give back to the community.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have worked with Spanish media companies since we launched Frontity PRO, and the result has been great. Our theme has allowed them to deliver faster and more engaging mobile experiences, which has been proven to increase their pageviews and ad revenue. Our internal framework has served content to more than 20 million readers. Some of our major clients were part of ADSLZone group, like <em>Medios y Redes</em>, <em>Tendenzias</em> or Coches.com. They all use WordPress.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, we realized that many of our clients&#8217; tech teams were considering using our framework to develop their own custom themes. This was one of the main reasons that made us think about open sourcing it — it seemed the perfect moment. Plus, this was our original vision.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, we finally decided to go straight for that vision. We set aside the development work of Frontity PRO to place all our focus on Frontity.org, the open source framework. Our next milestone is to release the first beta version in the next few weeks. (Early May 2019.) More than 300 developers have already signed up to try it out. We are really excited about this project and believe it can make a real impact in the WordPress ecosystem.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our resources are limited, we are looking for some financial backing again to bring contributors on board and build a thriving community of people interested in WordPress and React.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PS: What problems does Frontity solve? (And whose problems are they?) Will Frontity make frontend development more accessible to people who are new to React?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> In order to create a WordPress theme with React, developers need to learn and configure lots of different things: bundling, transpiling, routing, server rendering, retrieving data from WordPress, managing state, managing CSS, linting, testing,&#8230;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are already some amazing React frameworks, such as Next.js and GatsbyJS, that can work with WordPress, but they&#8217;re not focused exclusively on it. As a result, there&#8217;s still some complex configuration and additional tooling left to the developer. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what Frontity aims to solve; we want to make everything much simpler for WordPress developers and more accessible to those who are new to React. Each part of the framework has been simplified and optimized to be used with WordPress, and developers don&#8217;t need to figure out what tools to use for things like CSS or state management.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is ready so they can get WordPress and React to work together in an easier way. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Frontity differ from Genesis, _s, or WP Rig — from the developer and designer&#8217;s perspective, and in the end user&#8217;s experience?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> Genesis, _s or WP Rig are fantastic frameworks to develop WordPress themes based on PHP. These themes use the PHP WordPress rendering engine, which means they rely on a server-side architecture where almost every interaction that is made by the user on his device needs to wait for the server to render the new result. Our framework is focused on developers who want to create a React frontend and connect it to a WordPress backend using the REST API. We can call this a client-side architecture, where all the logic and rendering happen directly on the device and the calls to the server are limited only to data sourcing.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, web development has evolved a lot. One of the main reasons is the shift to mobile devices and the need for fast web experiences. Achieving this is not easy using a server-side architecture. This is why client-side libraries like React are becoming so popular.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the developer perspective, everything changes! A theme developed with Frontity and React has zero PHP in it, only JavaScript and CSS. This might sound like a radical change, but there is a trend of developers using WordPress as a headless CMS with a decoupled JavaScript frontend for whom our framework can be quite useful.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Frontity the framework fit into a business model or revenue stream for Frontity the company?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> We won&#8217;t develop any business model in this initial phase. The framework will always be 100% free and open source. Right now, we are focused on building a community of developers and contributors around the framework.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible monetizations in the future are a hosting solution, premium support, or a marketplace of paid themes.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see for WordPress developers now and in the near future? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> With the shift to Gutenberg as well as the rise of headless CMS approaches, the WordPress community has started considering React for their projects. Beside this, modern libraries like React are becoming essential to rich user experiences.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The client-side approach to theme-building opens a world of new possibilities: storing and pre-fetching content, animations within themes, offline experiences, and more. It also has enormous benefits in terms of performance, UX and design.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>React presents an opportunity to accelerate things in the WordPress ecosystem, build modern and engaging frontend experiences, and extend what developers can do with this powerful CMS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Pictured in the Frontity team photo above, from left to right, back row first: Eduardo Campaña (developer), David Arenas (developer), Carmen Fernández (no longer with the company), Mario Santos, (Community), Reyes Martínez (Marketing &amp; Communications), Pablo Postigo (Founder &amp; CEO), and Luis Herranz (Founder &amp; Lead developer).</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 May 2019 17:48:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2019 Tickets Now on Sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2019-tickets-now-on-sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3340:\"<p><a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tickets</a> for WordCamp US 2019 went on sale this week.

The audit was crowdfunded by the WordPress community and Matt Mullenweg and Automattic pledged to cover the balance to ensure it would be fully funded. </p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s analysis includes a <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">329-page technical audit</a> of the editor along with <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_UX_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">user-based testing</a> that included people with various disabilities. WPCampus&#8217; announcement presents Tenon&#8217;s findings in a measured and diplomatic way, encouraging the community to use the report for improving WordPress: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Please use this report as what it is intended to be: constructive feedback in support of the WordPress project. We hope this report generates discussion about accessibility, excitement about inclusive design, and action toward improving the editing experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Beyond its use for WordPress core, the audit is also a valuable resource for those extending Gutenberg and more broadly for developers who are building React-based projects.</p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s report includes a 34-page <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Executive_Summary.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Summary</a>, highlighting key findings from the usability testing and technical review. It&#8217;s important to note that the audit was conducted on WordPress version 5.0.3 in January 2019. Since that time the Gutenberg and Accessibility teams have resolved an additional <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A%3E2019-01-03\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">116 accessibility issues</a>, which will be included in WordPress 5.2 next week.</p>\n<p>As expected, Tenon&#8217;s results show that overall the markup generated by Gutenberg is &#8220;clean, semantically correct and accessible&#8221; but that &#8220;Gutenberg’s user experience is consistently poor.&#8221; The audit found that Gutenberg fails to comply with all 30 of the WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria. </p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s findings confirm the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team published in October 2018 regarding the editor&#8217;s overall level of accessibility:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The accessibility team will continue to work to support Gutenberg to the best of our ability. However, based on its current status, we cannot recommend that anybody who has a need for assistive technology allow it to be in use on any sites they need to use at this time.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>At that time, many WordPress contributors urged leadership not to ship an editor with critical accessibility issues that prevented people using assistive technologies from moving forward with the latest version.</p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s Executive Summary concludes that the new editor is a step backwards for people with disabilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gutenberg has significant and pervasive accessibility problems, the likes of which amount to a step backwards for users with disabilities over the legacy editor. Our user-based testing – backed by data from our technical review – indicates that the accessibility problems are severe in nature. We feel concerned that Gutenberg’s current accessibility issues will prove problematic for website owners who deploy Gutenberg to content creators in protected populations or for website owners who are themselves part of a protected population. Therefore, organizations which have high risk profiles should consult legal counsel before using it and may want to choose to use the legacy editor instead.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tenon recommended that Gutenberg&#8217;s developers aggressively tackle the issues uncovered in the <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technical report</a>, given the size of WordPress&#8217; user base. The full report essentially functions as a guide for anyone who wants to contribute to the new editors&#8217; accessibility. It is an excellent resource that outlines each issue with solutions and recommended code, making it easy for developers to get started with meaningful contributions right away. Tenon has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/created_by/karlgroves\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">created a collection of 84 issues on GitHub</a> based on the findings in the audit and six of them have already been resolved/closed. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 May 2019 19:59:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-rc2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2474:\"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 5.2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 will be released on <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-2/\">Tuesday, May 7</a></strong>, but we need <em>your</em> help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.2 yet, now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.2 release candidate: try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2-RC2.zip\">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For details about what to expect in WordPress 5.2, please see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">first release candidate post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes the final About page design.

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Went through some hard times when I was in university. It was also difficult for me to pay the university dues due to financial shortcomings.</p>\n<p>I am a sportsman and still have a wish to play in International Cricket which seems impossible from where I am today. At one point, I wished to join Pakistan Air Force but life directed me towards Computer Sciences.</p>\n<p>I started using a computer in ​2010​ when I joined <a href=\"https://gcuf.edu.pk/\">​Government College University Faisalabad​</a>. Came to know about WordPress while I was finishing the last semester of my degree and my FYP was based on WordPress.</p>\n<p>My mother&#8211;who is no more in this world&#8211;was the real hero of my life and stayed by my side till her last breath. I remember my kindergarten days when she helped me with my homework. I remember the moments in which she used to stay standing in front of the house while I drove off to school.</p>\n<p>I remember her last day at the hospital. I met her in the ICU before her heart surgery. She hugged me and said ​“<strong>Don’t worry, everything will be good</strong>”​. She expired during the surgery. I pray for her soul to rest in peace every day.</p>\n<h3>Start of Career:</h3>\n<p>Something had always felt missing in my life, but I felt like I was on the right track for the first time in my life when I joined the WordPress community. After graduation, I struggled a lot to get my first job. I joined <a href=\"https://www.presstigers.com/\">​PressTigers​</a> as a Software Engineer and continued struggling to make my position better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FahadShakeel\">Khawaja Fahad Shakeel​</a> was my first mentor. For me, it has always been an honour to work with him. He directed me towards the right path and provided me with endless support.</p>\n<h3>Community &#8211; WordCamps and Meetups:</h3>\n<p>I am using WordPress since ​2015​. Once I started attending meetups and open source contribution, it turned out to be a game changer for me.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>I learned a lot of things from the WordPress Community platform. There are a lot of personalities who have left a deep impression on met. One of them is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jainnidhi03\">​Nidhi Jain​</a> from Udaipur India. At this point, she is like a sister to me. We have an amazing chemistry when it comes to working on WordPress dev. The second one is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/desrosj\">​Jonathan Desrosiers​</a> who is like my big brother whom I have learned a lot from and continue to do more every day.</p>\n<p>WordPress Community is where I feel the most comfortable, after my family. I am supporting local WordPress communities and was part of ​WordCamp Karachi​ as an organizer. It was the first time that I spoke in an international level event.</p>\n<p>People around the globe know me because of WordPress. This is why WordPress is my identity. I owe a huge part of who I am to the WordPress Community.</p>\n<h3>WordPress and Future:</h3>\n<p>I believe WordPress can never die as long as people don’t stop baking new things and curating it according to the demands of the new era.</p>\n<p><em>The beauty of WordPress is that it is made for everyone.</em></p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Lahore/members/?op=leaders&sort=name\">​co-organizer of WordPress Meetup Lahore​</a> it is an honor for me to provide a platform for people to gather under one roof, to learn and share something with the community. I believe in diversity and would love to involve more people in the community leadership team.</p>\n<p>I am extremely hopeful regarding the WordPress Meetup Lahore group and welcome everyone to contribute into making it great.</p>\n<p>I have been terribly impressed by <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">​Marcel​</a> as he walked for WC Europe and I would love to walk for WC Asia after the approval.</p>\n<p>In the future, if I get a chance in politics, I wish to be a part of upper house as a <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov.pk/\">​SENATOR OF PAKISTAN​</a>. Hopefully, I will be contesting in the next senate election either from the platform of the ruling party or as an independent candidate.</p>\n<h3>Community Mentor:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Usman__Khalid\">Usman Khalid​</a>, the lead organizer of WC Karachi, is the hero behind the scenes for establishing the communities in Pakistan. He has mentored me for community relevant stuff. I would love to credit him, the person who gathered the Pakistani WordPress folks under one roof for the first time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Message for WordPressers:</h3>\n<p><em>If you seriously want to do something for yourself, do something for others first.</em></p>\n<p>Go for open source, you’ll surely learn how to code. You’ll learn how to work in a team. Join local meetups, meet with the folks: help them, learn from them and share ideas.</p>\n<h3>Wrap Up:</h3>\n<p>One thing I have learned from life is that there is no shortcut to success. You have to work hard to achieve your goals. The person who lives in a fantasy world will never succeed in life.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I have achieved something great. I still have the thirst to do something; lots and lots of missions to be accomplished. My only wish is to do something different for this world which will be remembered long after I am gone.</p>\n<p>Together we grow.

This indicates that the JavaScript user base is becoming more sophisticated overall. </p>\n<p>Another trend is the rising popularity of GraphQL. While its adoption is still relatively low, with only 7% of respondents indicating that they use it frequently, 23% of developers use it for some of their projects. The results showed that 72% of npm users are using or considering using GraphQL in 2019.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-4.36.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In a post that goes further in depth on <a href=\"https://medium.com/npm-inc/methodology-of-the-2018-2019-javascript-ecosystem-survey-and-results-b1cef1b83f10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the methodology used for the survey</a>, nmp Inc. said the company did not collect demographics on race or gender identity, so the data may not be representative of the broader population of JavaScript users on these metrics.

NetBeans joins more than 350 other open source projects and initiatives managed by the foundation after spending two years in the Apache Incubator.</p>\n<p>The IDE supports Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, and other popular programming languages, and is also used as a tooling platform and application framework. Although PhpStorm and Sublime Text capture a larger share of the IDE market for PHP developers, there is a small but passionate segment of WordPress developers who favor NetBeans as their IDE of choice.</p>\n<p>NetBeans started as a student project in 1996 in what was formerly known as Czechoslovakia. It was the first Java IDE written in Java but it soon became more than just an IDE platform, as the community began using it to create applications that weren&#8217;t development tools. In 2000, Sun Microsystems acquired NetBeans and open sourced it, making it Sun&#8217;s first sponsored open source project. It became part of Oracle when it acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 and the company continues to sponsor the project. NetBeans is now used by more than 1.5 million users each month.</p>\n<p>Now that Apache NetBeans is governed by the ASF, it will be more likely to receive contributions than when it belonged to a commercial entity. However, contributors from Oracle and other organizations will continue to be part of shaping its future. Coming under the ASF umbrella is also bringing some welcome developments for the project&#8217;s governance, according to Apache NetBeans Vice President Geertjan Wielenga:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being part of the ASF means that NetBeans is now not only free and Open Source software: it is also, uniquely, and for the first time, part of a foundation specifically focused on enabling open governance. Every contributor to the project now has equal say over the roadmap and direction of NetBeans. That is a new and historic step and the community has been ready for this for a very long time. Thanks to the strong stewardship of NetBeans in Sun Microsystems and Oracle, Apache NetBeans is now ready for the next phase in its development and we welcome everyone to participate as equals as we move forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oracle&#8217;s decision to submit NetBeans to the ASF Incubator came as a surprise to many in 2016. At that time, OSI President Simon Phipps <a href=\"https://meshedinsights.com/2016/09/15/oracle-gets-it-right-netbeans-heads-to-apache/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared his thoughts</a> about the benefits he saw for the project moving to open governance under the ASF:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By moving to independent governance and losing the Oracle CLA, others can join in with confidence their contribution won’t be used against them. More importantly, contributors also no longer need fear the transient decisions of cost-cutting Oracle VPs impacting the long-term viability of the project. Oracle’s Java team still needs NetBeans in order to make tools releases supporting new capabilities in Java 9 and later, so are likely to engage. Rather than withdrawal, this looks more like leveraging the ecosystem around NetBeans to sustain development while keeping Oracle’s costs in line with the direct benefit NetBeans delivers to them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/NetBeansProposal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> submitted to the ASF for NetBeans&#8217; acceptance into the Incubator, the majority of code contributions have come from Oracle since it acquired Sun Microsystems. In addressing some of the known risks Oracle faces in contributing NetBeans to the ASF, the proposal states that &#8220;the size and diversity of the community is a guarantee against the project being orphaned.&#8221; </p>\n<p>NetBean&#8217;s proposal said the purpose of moving NetBeans to Apache is to &#8220;expand the diversity of contributors and to increase the level of meritocracy.&#8221; The project already has a good foundation to build on, as its application framework is used by large companies and organizations, including Boeing, Airbus Defense and Space, NASA, and NATO, that depend on NetBeans for building mission critical scientific software. This new era of open governance should give the community a stronger sense of ownership and stimulate greater levels of contribution across the project. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 02:18:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6909\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3119:\"<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone as we progress toward the WordPress 5.2 release date. “Release Candidate” means that the new version is ready for release, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible something was missed.

However, more than half of all WordPress users (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~55%</a>) are not running version 5.0+. Nearly 30% are hanging back at 4.9 and 25% are on even older versions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-23-at-10.05.35-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a> </p>\n<p>Theme authors who create products that have Gutenberg-only features are not yet building for the majority of WordPress users. These authors are carving a path for the future of theme development. The Clean Blocks theme doesn&#8217;t really fall into this category, as its essentially enables users on WordPress 5.0+ to continue using the new editor without any styling issues. It is also compatible with earlier versions of WordPress (4.8+).</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks recommends a collection of Catch Themes&#8217; functionality plugins upon theme activation. These plugins handle things like galleries, infinite scroll, Instagram feeds, widgets, and additional content types. The theme includes dozens of options in the Customizer for controlling nearly every aspect of how content is displayed &#8211; from excerpt length to categories displayed on the home page to header text color. This sort of overloaded Customizer options panel is common for multipurpose style themes, and many users have come to expect it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/demo/clean-blocks-free/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out a demo</a> of the free version to see all the features in action.</p>\n<p>The name &#8220;Clean Blocks&#8221; implies that the theme goes beyond the basics to customize the Gutenberg experience, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. The vast majority of the features seen in the demo are controlled by the Customizer. For example, features like Testimonials and Services are not available as blocks. While some theme authors opt to integrate features like this by pairing their themes with block collection plugins, Catch Themes has put everything into the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Even with Gutenberg compatibility, many themes still have a disconnect between the back and frontend where certain features can only be configured in the Customizer. This fractured customization experience is one of the necessary evils for this transition time before the block editor is fully capable of handling more complex aspects of site customization.</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks is an example of a multipurpose theme that is essentially keeping it old school in terms of content customization, while providing basic Gutenberg compatibility for users who are running WordPress 5.0+. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/clean-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on WordPress.org</a> and has already been downloaded several hundred times during its first week in the directory. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 22:46:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Laraberg, a Gutenberg Implementation for Laravel, is Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89058\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3954:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The family of Gutenberg derivatives is expanding with the beta release of <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg</a>, an implementation for Laravel. <a href=\"http://mauricewijnia.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Wijnia</a>, a developer at <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, an agency based in Amsterdam, created Laraberg as an easy way for developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor. It includes a simple API and support for the <a href=\"https://unisharp.github.io/laravel-filemanager/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel File Manager</a> for uploading files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal for Laraberg is to give developers the ability to add the Gutenberg editor to any page they like in a way that is as easy as possible, but at the same time it has to prove enough options to tailor the editor so it can fit into any Laravel project out there,&#8221; Wijnia said.</p>\n<p>Van Ons has a <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/nieuws/gutenberg-in-laravel-hier-is-laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preference for using Laravel</a> in their projects, due to its increasing popularity and active community. Laraberg makes it possible for the agency to tap into the convenience of the Gutenberg editor without giving up the performance and features they enjoy in the Laravel framework. The beta release is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/van-ons/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Packagist</a>. Van Ons plans to actively implement Laraberg in their own projects and will also be collecting feedback from beta testers. </p>\n<p>Wijnia said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project, whose creators also authored <a href=\"https://github.com/front/gutenberg-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg.js</a>, a package that makes it easier to bring Gutenberg into other applications. Providing a foundation for using Gutenberg on any CMS or framework is part of Frontkom&#8217;s long term vision for improving the open web and enabling communities to collaborate on mutually beneficial extensions.</p>\n<p>As the editor continues to expand to more platforms and frameworks, a CMS-agnostic block library would offer a central place for Gutenberg&#8217;s increasingly diverse user base to discover new blocks. WordPress.org has the opportunity to provide that in its own block library, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/#comment-8947\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with the support of the Gutenberg Cloud team</a> that pioneered the idea in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Gutenberg Cloud can serve as a proof of concept that WP.org can later adopt as their own, we are happy,&#8221; Frontkom CTO Per Andre Rønsen said. He also further commented on the WordPress.org Block Library proposal, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-cloud-team-advocates-for-making-wordpress-orgs-new-block-directory-a-cms-agnostic-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advocating for the team to grow their vision beyond the WordPress community</a> only. No official decision has been announced yet. If WordPress decides to forgo the opportunity of providing a block library inclusive of other frameworks and platforms, then the Gutenberg Cloud will continue to be the place for discovering blocks that can be used across multiple platforms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:24:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30665:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Be the person you needed when you were younger.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#pt-br\">Este ensaio também está disponível em português.</a></p>\n<p>As I make a checklist of all the things I’ll have to pack to travel from São Paulo to Berlin, to attend WordCamp Europe 2019, I can&#8217;t stop thinking how hard the path to this point has been.</p>\n<p>For some of people, a travel like this may seem ordinary, but for me, this will be the farthest I&#8217;ve ever been until now, in many ways. Especially because the last time I was planning to attend an international WordCamp, things didn&#8217;t work out at all.</p>\n<p>So let me tell you about the path.</p>\n<h3>The first steps</h3>\n<p>I was born and raised in São Paulo. Allow me to give you some context about my city. São Paulo is the richest and biggest city of Brazil. With more than 14 million people, it&#8217;s also the biggest city of the south hemisphere. It&#8217;s even bigger than New York.</p>\n<p>Like every big city, São Paulo is a place of opportunities, but also a place of contrasts.</p>\n<p>Growing up, although we were poor, my family cared a lot about the education of me and my little brother. My father who always liked technology, managed to get a computer for us in 1996. At that time, I was 6 years old, and we were the only family in my neighborhood to have a computer for a long time, and that was sad. That early exposure to technology made a big difference in my life.</p>\n<p>At age 13, I was very interested in graphic design and coding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a very limited and expensive dial-up internet, that was only free after midnight and at weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So to learn these skills, my best options were the CD-ROM magazines that my father would bring home. I also learned about HTML with a book about Microsoft Front Page. At age 14 I sold my first website, entirely created on Front Page, with lots of GIFs and &lt;marquee&gt; tags, for a neighbour who needed it for a college project. She loved it!</p>\n<p>I decided I wanted to work with design. So I started a Graphic Design course during the high school. With my love for web design, all I wanted was to have a site that was actually online. I couldn’t afford a host, but fortunately at this time, blogs became very popular here in Brazil.</p>\n<p>I looked for a platform to create a portfolio. I played a little with one called WordPress (you may have heard of it) and ended up using Blogger instead, because there was the possibility to customize the theme’s CSS online. I made a very dark grungy theme for my blog that’s still online.</p>\n<h3>A bumpy road</h3>\n<p>I got a scholarship for Graphic Design at a good College in São Paulo, but I still would have to pay for half of the monthly tuition. The problem was that my family definitely had no means to afford it. My parents said they would cut some expenses and help me, but I knew that there wasn’t anything they could cut. So I told them to not worry, I would find a job.</p>\n<p>At this point I had made a freelance gig creating a HTML website (in Dreamweaver this time). With exactly 1 month left for the College application, this client proposed that I started working there to maintain the website I just made. So I was able to (barely) pay for the college. After six months, I applied for a full scholarship and it was granted. Things got a little better financially, but the path was still rocky.</p>\n<p>It took me 3 hours by bus from my house to the college every single day, just inside the city of São Paulo (remember when I said this city is huge?).</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had the cheapest hot dog for lunch every day, because I couldn’t afford a real meal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then I would go to work (another 1h30 of bus from the college), and at night I would head back home (another bus, another 1h30). That was my routine for one and a half year throughout the college. As you can imagine, I was exhausted, and eventually getting ill.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>That’s when I decided that I would quit my job and start a business with my boyfriend Allyson Souza, that I met during my Graphic Design course in High School. We started the company officially in july, 2009. <a href=\"http://www.hastedesign.com.br/\">We named it Haste</a> (the portuguese word for “stem”).</p>\n<p>We were 19 years old, not much experience, zero network and money, a lot of energy, and some extra self-confidence (I could have summarized simply as “millennials”, right?). Allyson’s father gave us a computer and a part of his office, for which I am very grateful, and we created all the graphic materiais for his courses company in exchange.</p>\n<p>We started working with graphic design only, and it took us some time to realize that web development was our future.</p>\n<p>I remembered WordPress and tried it again. I liked how the platform had evolved. We made a second version of our website in WordPress, using a simple free theme, which I edited the CSS directly (oh god). We tried to create websites for clients modifying existing themes (at least we learned about child themes later), but we definitely didn’t feel in control of what we were doing.</p>\n<h3>When you hit your lowest point</h3>\n<p>In January 2011, my mother had a stroke. She had a brain surgery, and after a month, she was back home with a 6 inches scar in the head. That was the lowest point on my path.</p>\n<p>The next years I had to take care of her, because of some consequences of the stroke, both physical and psychological. As the only family member who hadn’t a “formal” job, with a boss and a defined schedule, I was the one who had to take her to appointments, or the ER, or stay home when she wasn’t ok. It was very hard to reconcile the final year of college, the work and my mom’s health care.</p>\n<h3>The only way is up</h3>\n<p>At Haste, we felt that things were not evolving. In 2013, after some partnerships that took us to some confusing paths, we decided to have a complete makeover. We defined a new focus: web design and development with WordPress. We created a new website, with a theme fully developed by us. We wanted to overcome the fear of coding, and wanted to know exactly what we were doing. So we started studying a lot by ourselves.</p>\n<p>Allyson was responsible for the PHP and JavaScript and I was supposed to make the design, the HTML and CSS. He started to ask a lot of questions in the group of WordPress Brasil community at Facebook. We finished the website, and people loved it, specially the illustration with parallax effect that made the girl move her eyes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were proud WordPress developers now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We started attending the meetups, and then the WordCamp. I was amazed how the open-source culture was all about sharing knowledge with strangers, with no fear of competition, just the spirit of collaboration. We felt no longer isolated. We made real friends (shout out to all my WordPress friends).</p>\n<p>Soon we were both involved in the community, and became WordCamp São Paulo organizers in 2014.</p>\n<p>The new website and our participation in the WordPress community were really what we needed to give us some perspective and stability. So we didn’t stop there.</p>\n<h3>Bring others to walk with you</h3>\n<p>In the 2014 edition of WordCamp São Paulo, I was the only female speaker. That made me realize a few things.</p>\n<p>First that the proportion of men in the community events was not only the majority but, we almost didn’t had any women at all, which was very weird.</p>\n<p>Second, we know that lots of girls feel intimidated in an environment with too much men. I always had a majority of male friends since I was a kid, and even so, I probably wouldn’t get involved with the community if it wasn’t by the fact that my boyfriend / partner was with me.</p>\n<p>A few sexists incidents had happened with me too. I reacted, and the men involved seemed to understand that I wasn’t ok, and changed their behavior as far as I know.</p>\n<p>We don’t have as many meetups and WordCamps here in Brazil as in US. Although Brazil is becoming a technology hub, the WordPress community has still a lot of room to grow, compared to other communities. So, I think we have the opportunity to make things different while everything is not settled yet.</p>\n<p>So I decided to act now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started a poll asking the women involved with WordPress the reasons why they wouldn’t attend the events. The results proved it wasn’t just me complaining about small things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some jokes kept women away. Some condescending actions made them feel diminished. And even the lack of information from our part, that the WordCamps are inclusive events, made the women not to come. The lack of time, was an important factor too.</p>\n<p>Based on this data, the next year we managed to increase the proportion of female speakers from 5% to 32% at WordCamp São Paulo 2015. More women became organizers too. In 2019 we have 4 women out of 10 active organizers. The last WordCamp we had blind people attending, and their feedback was great. We still need to improve racial diversity though.</p>\n<h3>Barriers and frontiers</h3>\n<p>In 2015, Allyson had told me about this new scholarship program from the WordPress Foundation for women who work for equality in the community around the world. So I applied for the very first Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship. Kim Parsell left a beautiful legacy of inclusion and love, having worked to bring more women, older people, and other minorities to the WordPress community. She was known as the #WPMom.</p>\n<p>The result came few months later. I received an email, and had no reaction for a few minutes. I had won the scholarship, and it granted me a travel to WordCamp US 2015, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, with flights and hotel covered.</p>\n<p>You see: I had never left my country. I had just took flight for the first time that same year. I was not even close to dream to go to US, because it was impossible for me at the moment. Sometimes your mindset in the only thing putting limitations in your dreams.</p>\n<p>I was so happy, you have no idea. Alx Block and Cami Kaos reached to me to give me instructions and they were very kind.</p>\n<p>But then… my visa application was denied. They considered my sudden passport and visa solicitation, with no money to travel (that’s exactly the point of a scholarship!), and lack “ties” in Brazil very suspicious. I told them that the WordPress Foundation would pay for everything. The flights and the hotel were already booked. The officer even told me that the WordPress Foundation letter could be easily forged. I tried again, with no success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2015.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2016 too, when they asked if I wanted to try again, and my visa was denied&#8230; again. This time I think at least the officer searched online for me, saw it was true, but couldn’t do anything, since my situation hadn’t change.</p>\n<p>I was so disappointed. This still hurts me, I must confess. Sometimes, there are real barriers and gates that a simple mindset change cannot open.</p>\n<h3>Crossed paths</h3>\n<p>The next years, I focused on my company and the work at the community. My mom’s health improved, she’s in great shape now. My family supports my work.</p>\n<p>We became specialists in WordPress at Haste. We developed themes, plugins and sites for companies in Brazil and America. I now have a stable income and I live exclusively from my work with WordPress. We are celebrating 10 years in 2019.</p>\n<p>I traveled through Brazil because of WordPress, to speak at WordCamps and Meetups. I see more and more women working with WordPress, attending meetups and WordCamps, and talking to each other, finding something familiar in every other woman’s face.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last year we decided we would go to WordCamp Europe 2019 in Berlin, since we don’t need a visa to most countries there, including Germany.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This time I can afford it (with a lot of planning and expenses cut, but I’ll be ok). I have to confess that I’m a little anxious about the immigration process.</p>\n<p>My goal at WordCamp Europe is to know the most people I can. It’s not a matter of quantity, but if the WordPress community taught me something was that every person has something to teach and to learn. So If you are attending WordCamp Europe, let’s meet!</p>\n<h3>Opening trails</h3>\n<p>So now I hope you can see what this travel really means to me, and why every small conquest means a lot. It’s not just because it was hard. But because I’m not the only one who deserve it, but unfortunately I’m a exception between other people who have the same background as I.</p>\n<p>There are so many young girls and boys that don’t dare to dream about visiting other countries, or even getting in the college. Lots of kids that don’t have a computer, or even access to internet. The only difference is that I was given opportunities, people believed in me. Doors were opened. And just then I could prove my value.</p>\n<p>Now my next dream is to be able to make the journey a little easier than it was for me, specially for women and young Brazilians. Because I think that’s our responsibility in the community. Teach others, share information, donate some of your time, create new tools, plugins and resources, mentor people. As my brother’s tattoo says, be the person you needed when you were younger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pt-br\">Como a comunidade WordPress me ajudou a encontrar o meu caminho</h2>\n<p>Enquanto faço uma lista de todas as coisas que preciso para viajar de São Paulo para Berlim, para participar do WordCamp Europe 2019, não posso deixar de pensar no quão difícil foi o caminho até esse ponto.</p>\n<p>Para algumas pessoas, uma viagem como essa pode parecer comum, mas, para mim, esse será o mais longe que já fui até agora, de muitas maneiras. Especialmente porque, da última vez que eu planejava participar de um WordCamp internacional, as coisas não deram certo.</p>\n<p>Então deixe-me contar sobre esse caminho.</p>\n<h3>Os primeiros passos</h3>\n<p>Eu nasci e cresci em São Paulo. Permita-me dar um pouco de contexto sobre minha cidade. São Paulo é a mais rica e maior cidade do Brasil. Com mais de 14 milhões de pessoas, é também a maior cidade do hemisfério sul. É maior que Nova York.</p>\n<p>Como toda grande cidade, São Paulo é um lugar de oportunidades, mas também de contrastes.</p>\n<p>Crescendo, apesar de sermos pobres, minha família se importava muito com a minha educação e do meu irmão mais novo. Meu pai, que sempre gostou de tecnologia, conseguiu um computador para nós em 1996. Naquela época, eu tinha 6 anos, e éramos a única família das redondezas a ter um computador por um longo tempo, e isso era triste. Essa exposição precoce à tecnologia fez uma grande diferença na minha vida.</p>\n<p>Aos 13 anos, eu já estava interessada em design gráfico e programação. Nós tínhamos aquela internet discada muito limitada e cara, que só era gratuita depois da meia-noite e nos fins de semana. Então, para aprender essas habilidades, minhas melhores opções eram as revistas em CD-ROM que meu pai trazia para casa. Eu também aprendi sobre HTML com um livro sobre o Microsoft Front Page. Aos 14 anos, vendi meu primeiro site, inteiramente criado no Front Page, com muitos GIFs e tags &lt;marquee&gt;, para uma vizinha que precisava para um projeto da faculdade. Ela adorou!</p>\n<p>Eu decidi que queria trabalhar com design. Então fiz o curso técnico em design gráfico durante o ensino médio. Com o meu interesse pelo web design, tudo o que eu queria era ter um site que estivesse online. Eu não podia pagar um servidor, mas felizmente, neste momento, os blogs se tornaram muito populares aqui no Brasil.</p>\n<p>Procurei uma plataforma para criar um portfólio. Eu brinquei um pouco com uma plataforma chamada WordPress (você pode ter ouvido falar dela) mas acabei usando o Blogger, porque havia a possibilidade de personalizar o CSS do tema online. Eu fiz um tema escuro e grunge para o meu blog que ainda está online.</p>\n<h3>Uma estrada esburacada</h3>\n<p>Consegui uma bolsa de Design Gráfico em uma boa faculdade em São Paulo, mas ainda teria que pagar metade da mensalidade. O problema era que minha família definitivamente não tinha como arcar com isso. Meus pais disseram que cortariam algumas despesas e me ajudariam, mas eu sabia que não havia nada que pudessem cortar. Então eu disse a eles para não se preocuparem, eu encontraria um emprego.</p>\n<p>Neste momento, eu havia feito um trabalho freelancer criando um site HTML (no Dreamweaver desta vez). Com exatamente 1 mês para o aplicativo da faculdade, esta cliente propôs que eu começasse a trabalhar lá para manter o site que tinha acabado de criar. Então eu pude pagar pela faculdade (bem mal). Depois de seis meses, solicitei uma bolsa de estudos integral e ela foi concedida. As coisas melhoraram um pouco financeiramente, mas o caminho ainda era rochoso.</p>\n<p>Levava 3 horas de ônibus da minha casa para a faculdade todos os dias, apenas dentro da cidade de São Paulo (lembra quando eu disse que essa cidade é enorme?). Eu comia um cachorro-quente mais barato para o almoço todos os dias, porque eu não podia pagar uma refeição de verdade. Então eu ia trabalhar (outra 1h30 de ônibus da faculdade), e à noite eu voltava para casa (outro ônibus, outro 1h30). Essa foi a minha rotina por um ano e meio durante a faculdade. Como você pode imaginar, eu estava exausta e ficando doente.</p>\n<h3>Uma bifurcação no caminho</h3>\n<p>Foi então que decidi largar meu trabalho e começar um negócio com meu namorado Allyson Souza, que conheci durante o curso de Design Gráfico no Ensino Médio. Nós começamos a empresa oficialmente em julho de 2009. Nós a nomeamos Haste.</p>\n<p>Nós tínhamos 19 anos de idade, não muita experiência, zero networking e dinheiro, muita energia e alguma autoconfiança extra (eu poderia ter resumido simplesmente como “millennials”, certo?). O pai do Allyson nos deu um computador e uma parte de seu escritório, pelo que sou muito grata, e criamos todos os materiais gráficos para sua empresa de cursos em troca.</p>\n<p>Começamos a trabalhar apenas com design gráfico e levamos algum tempo para perceber que o desenvolvimento web era o nosso futuro.</p>\n<p>Lembrei-me do WordPress e tentei novamente. Eu gostei de como a plataforma evoluiu. Fizemos uma segunda versão do nosso site no WordPress, usando um simples tema gratuito, que eu editei diretamente o CSS (não façam isso!). Tentamos criar websites para clientes que modificando temas existentes (pelo menos aprendemos sobre temas filhos mais tarde), mas definitivamente não nos sentíamos no controle do que estávamos fazendo.</p>\n<h3>Quando você atinge seu ponto mais baixo</h3>\n<p>Em janeiro de 2011, minha mãe teve um AVC. Ela fez uma cirurgia no cérebro, e depois de um mês, ela estava em casa com uma cicatriz na cabeça. Esse foi o ponto mais baixo do meu caminho.</p>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes eu tive que cuidar dela, por causa de algumas consequências do AVC, tanto físicas quanto psicológicas. Como a única pessoa da família que não tinha um emprego “formal”, com um chefe e um horário de trabalho definido, fui eu quem teve que levá-la às consultas, ao pronto-socorro ou ficar em casa quando ela não estava bem. Foi bem difícil conciliar o último ano da faculdade, o trabalho e cuidar da saúde da minha mãe.</p>\n<h3>O único caminho é para cima</h3>\n<p>Na Haste, sentimos que as coisas não estavam evoluindo. Em 2013, após algumas parcerias que nos levaram a caminhos confusos, decidimos fazer uma reformulação completa. Definimos um novo foco: web design e desenvolvimento com WordPress. Criamos um novo site, com um tema totalmente desenvolvido por nós. Queríamos superar o medo de programar e queríamos saber exatamente o que estávamos fazendo. Então começamos a estudar muito por conta própria.</p>\n<p>Allyson ficou responsável pelo PHP e JavaScript e eu deveria fazer o design, o HTML e CSS. Ele começou a postar muitas perguntas no grupo da comunidade WordPress Brasil no Facebook. Nós terminamos o site, e as pessoas adoraram, especialmente a ilustração com efeito de paralaxe que fez a garota mover seus olhos. Nós éramos orgulhosos desenvolvedores do WordPress agora.</p>\n<p>Nós começamos a frequentar os meetups, e depois o WordCamp da comunidade WordPress. Fiquei espantada com a forma como a cultura de código aberto era toda sobre compartilhar conhecimento com estranhos, sem medo de competir, apenas o espírito de colaboração. Não nos sentíamos mais isolados. Nós fizemos amigos de verdade (alô amigos do WordPress).</p>\n<p>Logo nos envolvemos na comunidade e nos tornamos organizadores do WordCamp São Paulo em 2014.</p>\n<p>O novo site e nossa participação na comunidade WordPress foram realmente o que precisávamos para nos dar alguma perspectiva e estabilidade. Então nós não paramos por aí.</p>\n<h3>Traga os outros para caminhar com você</h3>\n<p>Na edição de 2014 do WordCamp São Paulo, eu era a única palestrante mulher. Isso me fez perceber algumas coisas.</p>\n<p>Primeiro, a proporção de homens nos eventos da comunidade não era apenas a maioria, mas quase não tínhamos nenhuma mulher. O que era muito estranho.</p>\n<p>Em segundo lugar, sabemos que muitas mulheres se sentem intimidadas em um ambiente com muitos homens. Eu sempre tive a maioria de amigos homens desde criança, e mesmo assim, eu provavelmente não me envolveria com a comunidade se não fosse pelo fato de meu namorado / sócio estar comigo.</p>\n<p>Alguns incidentes sexistas também aconteceram comigo. Eu reagi, e os homens envolvidos parecem ter entendido o problema, e mudaram seus comportamentos até onde eu sei.</p>\n<p>Não temos tantos meetups e WordCamps aqui no Brasil como nos EUA. Embora o Brasil esteja lentamente se tornando um polo de tecnologia, a comunidade WordPress ainda tem muito espaço para crescer, em comparação com outras comunidades. Então, acho que temos a oportunidade de fazer as coisas diferentes enquanto tudo ainda não está definido.</p>\n<p>Então eu decidi mudar isso.</p>\n<p>Eu comecei uma pesquisa perguntando às mulheres envolvidas com WordPress quais eram as razões pelas quais elas não compareciam aos eventos. Os resultados provaram que não era só eu reclamando de pequenas coisas.</p>\n<p>Algumas piadas mantinham as mulheres afastadas. Algumas ações condescendentes fizeram com que se sentissem diminuídas. E mesmo a falta de informação de nossa parte, de que os WordCamps são eventos inclusivos, fez com que as mulheres não viessem. A falta de tempo também foi um fator importante.</p>\n<p>Com base nesses dados, no ano seguinte conseguimos aumentar a proporção de mulheres palestrantes de 5% para 32% no WordCamp São Paulo 2015. Mais mulheres se tornaram organizadoras também. Em 2019, temos 4 mulheres de 10 organizadores ativos. No último WordCamp, tivemos deficientes visuais comparecendo e o feedback deles foi ótimo. Ainda precisamos melhorar a diversidade racial.</p>\n<h3>Barreiras e fronteiras</h3>\n<p>Em 2015, Allyson me contou sobre o novo programa de bolsas de estudos da Fundação WordPress para mulheres que trabalham pela igualdade na comunidade em todo o mundo. Então me inscrevi para a primeira bolsa Kim Parsell Memorial. Kim Parsell deixou um lindo legado de inclusão e amor, tendo trabalhado para trazer mais mulheres, pessoas mais velhas e outras minorias para a comunidade WordPress. Ela era conhecida como a #WPMom.</p>\n<p>O resultado veio alguns meses depois. Recebi um email e não tive reação por alguns minutos. Eu tinha ganhado a bolsa que me garantia uma viagem para o WordCamp US 2015, na Filadélfia, na Pensilvânia, com voos e hotel cobertos.</p>\n<p>Veja bem: eu nunca tinha saído do meu país. Eu tinha acabado de voar de avião pela primeira vez naquele mesmo ano. Eu não estava nem perto de sonhar em ir para os EUA, porque era impossível para mim no momento. Às vezes sua mentalidade na única coisa colocando limitações em seus sonhos.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão feliz, você não faz ideia. Alx Block e Cami Kaos entraram em contato para me dar instruções e foram muito gentis.</p>\n<p>Mas então&#8230; meu pedido de visto foi negado. Eles consideraram minha solicitação repentina de passaporte e visto, sem dinheiro para viajar (esse é exatamente o ponto de uma bolsa de estudos!),  e a falta de “laços” no Brasil muito suspeitos. Eu disse a eles que a Fundação WordPress pagaria por tudo. Os voos e o hotel já estavam reservados. O oficial até me disse que a carta da Fundação WordPress poderia ser facilmente falsificada. Eu tentei de novo, sem sucesso.</p>\n<p>Eu não pude ir para o WordCamp US 2015.</p>\n<p>Eu também não pude ir ao WordCamp US 2016, quando eles perguntaram se eu queria tentar novamente, e meu visto foi negado&#8230; de novo. Desta vez, acho que pelo menos o oficial pesquisou on-line por mim, viu que era verdade, mas não conseguiu fazer nada, pois minha situação não mudara.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão desapontada. Ainda fico triste de lembrar, devo confessar. Às vezes, existem barreiras e portões reais que uma simples mudança de mentalidade não pode abrir.</p>\n<h3>Caminhos cruzados</h3>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes, concentrei-me em minha empresa e no trabalho na comunidade. A saúde da minha mãe melhorou, ela está em ótima agora. Minha família apóia meu trabalho.</p>\n<p>Nós nos tornamos especialistas em WordPress na Haste. Desenvolvemos temas, plugins e sites para empresas no Brasil e na América. Agora tenho uma renda estável e vivo exclusivamente do meu trabalho com o WordPress. Estamos comemorando 10 anos em 2019.</p>\n<p>Eu viajei pelo Brasil por causa do WordPress, para falar em WordCamps e Meetups. Fui para Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre. Eu vejo mais e mais mulheres trabalhando com o WordPress, participando de meetups e WordCamps, e conversando, encontrando algo familiar no rosto das outras mulheres.</p>\n<p>No ano passado, decidimos que iríamos para o WordCamp Europa 2019 em Berlim, já que não precisamos de visto para a maioria dos países, incluindo a Alemanha.</p>\n<p>Desta vez, posso pagar (com muito planejamento e redução de despesas). Tenho que confessar que estou um pouco ansiosa com o processo de imigração.</p>\n<p>Meu objetivo no WordCamp Europa é conhecer o máximo de pessoas que posso. Não é uma questão de quantidade, mas se a comunidade do WordPress me ensinou algo foi que cada pessoa tem algo para ensinar e aprender. Então, se você estiver participando do WordCamp Europa, vamos nos conhecer!</p>\n<h3>Abrindo trilhas</h3>\n<p>Então agora eu espero que você possa ver o que essa viagem realmente significa para mim, e porque cada pequena conquista significa muito. Não é só porque foi difícil. Mas porque eu não sou a única que merece isso, mas infelizmente sou uma exceção entre outras pessoas que têm o mesmo histórico que eu.</p>\n<p>Há tantas meninas e meninos que não se atrevem a sonhar em visitar outros países ou até mesmo entrar na faculdade. E quando se atrevem, tem seus sonhos podados. Muitas crianças que não têm computador nem acesso à internet. A única diferença é que me foram dadas oportunidades, as pessoas acreditaram em mim. Portas foram abertas. E só então eu pude provar o meu valor.</p>\n<p>Agora meu próximo sonho é poder tornar a jornada um pouco mais fácil do que foi para mim, especialmente para mulheres e jovens brasileiros. Porque acho que é nossa responsabilidade na comunidade. Ensine outras pessoas, compartilhe informações, doe um pouco do seu tempo, crie novas ferramentas, plugins e recursos, oriente as pessoas. Como diz a tatuagem do meu irmão, seja a pessoa de que você precisava quando era mais jovem.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20the%20WordPress%20community%20helped%20me%20find%20my%20way&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F&title=How+the+WordPress+community+helped+me+find+my+way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-150x150.jpg&description=How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/\" title=\"How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/\">How the WordPress community helped me find my way</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 12:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Anyssa Ferreira\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Henry Zhu Launches New Maintainers Anonymous Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/henry-zhu-launches-new-maintainers-anonymous-podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3117:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maintainers Anonymous</a> is a new podcast created by <a href=\"https://www.henryzoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Zhu</a>, who has been the primary maintainer of <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Babel</a> for the past two years. Babel is a JavaScript compiler used by Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, and millions of others.

By presenting them as regular people, rather than faceless code projects, Zhu is aiming to encourage empathy for maintainers.</p>\n<p>Maintainers Anonymous is centered around the &#8220;how&#8221; of maintenance and Zhu is open to having guests from a variety of fields and disciplines, such as a librarian, gardener, or moderator. In an episode titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speedrunning with Omnigamer</a>,&#8221; Zhu and his first guest, Eric Koziel, discuss the intricacies of &#8220;speedrunning,&#8221; playing a video game with the goal of beating it as fast as possible. Koziel describes it as a medium for doing an optimization challenge. Since the games are just software, he and Zhu explored how speedrunning intersects with coding and talked about some of the parallels with maintaining open source software.</p>\n<p>The next two episodes are a series with guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sehurlburt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie Hurlburt</a>, a graphics engineer and owner of the company that makes <a href=\"http://www.binomial.info/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Basis</a>, an image/texture compression product.

It includes CSS tree shaking improvements that restore AMP compatibility for WordPress&#8217; default Twenty Nineteen theme, reducing the size of its stylesheet by 53%.</p>\n<p>In an effort to get more users opting for the Native mode option, the plugin&#8217;s development team has rebranded the template modes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this release the Paired mode has been rebranded as Transitional mode. One reason for this is that the classic mode was also a paired mode (where there are separate parallel URLs for the AMP version). But more importantly, the goal for this mode is to help facilitate a transition a site to being AMP-first, where there is no separate AMP-specific URLs. So the goal of the Transitional mode is to be a path to Native mode.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team has also decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/pull/2034\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rebrand Classic mode to “Reader” mode</a>, instead of deprecating it. It provides a basic AMP template for getting started that doesn&#8217;t necessarily match the site&#8217;s theme. Users can can add an “Exit Reader Mode” to the header of their sites with a setting in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 introduces compatibility with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA feature plugin</a>, bringing support for the service worker to AMP pages. It extends the service worker to cache AMP CDN assets, images, and Google Fonts. Since the PWA feature plugin is still under active development, the service worker integration is still considered experimental.</p>\n<p>Support for creating AMP Stories in WordPress is the next major feature coming to the plugin. A pre-release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/wiki/AMP-Stories-Experimental\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Stories editor</a> is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/releases/tag/1.2-alpha1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.2 alpha 1</a>, which also requires the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin. It uses the Gutenberg editor to allow users to build AMP stories with rich media capabilities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ctuGgKap-qE\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/CmLLaYT1Yy.gif?resize=627%2C353&ssl=1\" alt=\"Amp stories\" width=\"627\" height=\"353\" /></a></p>\n<p>A preview of the AMP Stories editor was unveiled at <a href=\"https://amp.dev/events/amp-conf-2019\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Conf 2019</a> in Tokyo, Japan.

In the past three years, Rich founded <a href=\"http://layup.media/\">a digital agency</a>, launched a popular PhotoShop <a href=\"https://purtypixels.com/\">resource site</a>, and started <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\">ThemeBeans</a>, a successful WordPress theme shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ThemeBeans and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\">CoBlocks</a>, Rich&#8217;s suite of page builder blocks in a plugin, have gone with him to Godaddy. (CoBlocks remains free, and now all the ThemeBeans products are too.)  Rich took some time to reflect with us on his path so far and where he sees the WordPress ecosystem going in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What led you to dive into the new post-Gutenberg reality of WordPress and create CoBlocks and Block Gallery? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been fascinated by the block editor ever since Matias’s Gutenberg demo during WordCamp US 2017. I was instantly convinced that Gutenberg would lead us into the next era of creation in WordPress. I saw an opportunity, was in a position to execute and had enough expertise to take it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did sales for these products meet your expectations?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually did not release paid versions for either CoBlocks or Block Gallery. There were plans to monetize both plugins, but at the time we were focused on delivering innovative solutions to Gutenberg and pushing the editor to its extremes. Adoption-wise, both plugins grew particularly fast, and are continuing to do so. In that sense, they most certainly exceeded my expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the near and long term future of the WordPress ecosystem? As solo developers and small firms are increasingly hired by bigger fish, especially hosting companies, will there still be a place for small entrepreneurs? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that the WordPress ecosystem will continue to be an innovative field for both entrepreneurs and larger companies. It’s all about innovation and being able to execute —  regardless of the size of the team behind the product or idea. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And over the last few years, the WordPress economy and its entrepreneurial leaders, have evolved into quite a mature ecosystem. I’d say the fact that companies such as GoDaddy are investing in the future of WordPress is a huge sign of that maturity and growth in our industry. Hosts, in particular, are uniquely equipped to make a huge difference in how so many folks use WordPress. Investing in products and talent that level-up the overall WordPress experience is good for us all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about GoDaddy made it seem like a good fit or you? Did you consider any other types of companies outside the hosting space?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I flew out to Phoenix to meet the WordPress leadership team at GoDaddy and it became quite clear that they were all-in on this new future of WordPress + Gutenberg.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy has assembled a passionate and highly qualified team of folks who are hyper-focused on improving the WordPress experience and leading the next wave of innovation in this space. Joining this team and leading the efforts as the Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience is a good and logical fit to fulfilling my personal mission to help make WordPress beautifully simpler. I knew that what we’d build would touch millions of sites and empower people all over the world to succeed online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Before GoDaddy came along, what was your plan in terms of growth and long-term sustainability?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having run a successful theme shop for a number of years, I understood the importance of having a solid plan for growth and sustainability. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My plan for both CoBlocks and Block Gallery was to release top-tiered paid versions of each, with innovative tools, blocks and design systems. Those would have likely arrived in Q3 of 2019, as our focus for the first half of the year was to innovate and grow our user base. Now I hope to continue on that same development trajectory, adding many of those same features to the current plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is your best advice for someone who is currently independent and wants to build a small business in the WordPress space today? What are the best lessons or advice you can provide?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, don’t let an opportunity get away from you. Learn to identify opportunities that you are perfectly suited to execute on, then dive right in. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for help and don’t be afraid to try something new. Learning how to learn and then taking that a step further by continuing to learn every single day, is a catalyst for enormous personal and professional growth. It’s not all about making cool stuff, it’s about challenging yourself to become the best version of yourself; the rest will fall into place. &nbsp;<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 21:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 Will Add 13 New Icons to the Dashicon Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88937\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2848:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dashicons</a>, the WordPress admin icon font, will be getting its first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> in three years when WordPress 5.2 ships.

I was working on a project for a woman&#8217;s rights organization that needed a &#8216;staff&#8217; post type. It was a little awkward explaining to them that there was a &#8216;businessman&#8217; icon we could use for free, or they could pay extra to have a custom &#8216;businesswoman&#8217; icon designed. Not a great look for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allen submitted a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/issues/285\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>, to see if someone would be willing to create a &#8220;businesswoman&#8221; and &#8220;businessperson&#8221; icon, but nobody had the time. Dashicons is maintained by a volunteer team and it can take a long time to get new icons designed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;About 5-6 months later I learned how to use Illustrator to create vector icons and submitted the icons myself,&#8221; Allen said. He <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/pull/323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">submitted the PR</a> and the new icons he created will be included in the next release of WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/business-people-icons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These business people icons are useful for projects that include creating things like custom post types for bios, testimonials, team members, and job postings.

It was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/14898\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renamed</a> to avoid confusion with the HTML5 section element and prevent potential overlap with future site/theme type sections, such as headers, sidebars, and footers. The first iteration of the Group block supports the ability to nest other blocks inside it and the ability to align the block and any of its child blocks that include alignment settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-17-at-12.41.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a minimal version at the moment and improvements about the flows to add inner blocks, group/ungroup blocks are expected in follow-up releases,&#8221; Gutenberg phase 2 technical lead Riad Benguella said. In testing the feature I found that it is indeed a rocky start and far from intuitive to use but a more refined grouping experience will be developed after further testing and feedback.</p>\n<p>The Group block lays the foundation for a future where WordPress themes may evolve to become block templates. In response to a comment about how the Group block could essentially replace the widget management interface, Benguella offered a glimpse of how Gutenberg will eventually transform the theme industry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a world where themes are made of block templates instead of php templates, there’s no need for widget areas.</p>\n<p>That said, Gutenberg is a huge change for WordPress and its community. With the new blocks concept, Phase 2 is about helping the WordPress community adopt this new concept without completely changing what a theme means in WordPress. We shouldn’t just abandon existing themes and switch into full-site editing without an iterative plan.</p>\n<p>We’ll eventually get there where everything is made of block templates and blocks but we need to make smaller steps first and the first one is the ability to use blocks instead of widgets in existing themes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.5 also adds the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14445\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">image fill option</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vertical alignment</a> support to the Media and Text blocks. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/media-text-vertical-align-small-1.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also includes a few minor but useful improvements, such as automatically populating the link field when the selected text is an email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-linked.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team is also making progress on the new widgets screen with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14612\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">barebones testing version</a> in place that will allow them to start investigating and tackling technical issues related to this screen.

Till now I was living my life with my own surroundings, now it will be no more that much of hidden.</p>\n<p>I am a very simple person from Kolkata, India. I started my career with IBM ACE i.e an IBM education wing, as a Technical Teacher. I used to teach my students several subjects like C,C++, Perl and PHP. Although I was teaching many subjects my focus was in PHP starting from 2003. In the early days of 2009 I came to know about WordPress. From the first few days I was struggling with the Administrative panel and other services.</p>\n<p>In 2009 end I decided to step down from my job and started differently. I started development work and also continue teaching the students.</p>\n<p>I was decided to develop the websites and web applications with the WordPress only, and I got the version called `Carmen` 2.9 which was a relief for me to handle the CMS. I got some help from my students and friends who were engaged in WordPress development at that time. They teach me how I can handle the WordPress more proficient way. I learnt how to develop WordPress themes, started developing the plugins.</p>\n<h3>Working with WordPress</h3>\n<p>I started developing the website using WordPress from 2010 onwards. Later on 2014 I started developing WordPress theme for the Themeforest Market place. I also started developing the plugins which helps my development process to run smoothly.</p>\n<h3>How it changed My life</h3>\n<p>My life started changing from 2010 when I started developing with WordPress. The instability of my life was changed into a stable life, which was beyond my expectation. I was living a good life with my family. What else I can expect from WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What’s Different</h3>\n<p>Apart from developing the Websites and other application, I started my research on how the development process can be more smoother and flexible. I started working on WP CLI to developing the automated process for WordPress. I developed a script that helps developers to install the WordPress flawlessly using WP CLI. My linux knowledge also helped me to write shell scripts. The script can be found in my account at github. I am also trying to get into the easy deployment process with CI/CD for the developers using Bitbucket Pipeline and AWS.</p>\n<p>I slowly become an expert on the theme approval guidelines of Themeforest Market place. Apart from that I started writing blogs on the various topics related to WordPress. Achieved almost 3K reputation in StackOverflow. Developed Plugins in wordpress.org.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Even though I was developed many plugins and theme I never thought of uploading that in wordpress.org. I start realizing that to help many more people in WordPress, wordpress.org will be a better place than StackOverflow.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Kolkata</h3>\n<p>I joined Kolkata WordPress Community who was planning the WordCamp Kolkata, and thankfully they have selected me as a volunteer. Mr Subrata Sarkar( WordPress Core Contributor ) and the team who recognized me and give a huge responsibilities in WordCamp Kolkata 2019. It was again a tremendous experiences with WordPress. Since that was my first WordCamp I tried to fulfill my responsibilities. Become a Volunteer I learnt to be more polite and more decent to the people, make many more friends from different regions and countries.</p>\n<h3>My Inspirations</h3>\n<p>There are many people who inspired and helped me during my journey, its small tribute to them by mentioning a few : Abhik Goswami, Sneh Sagar Prajapati, Prabhas Chowdhury, Debobrata Debnath, Prosenjit Manna, Sk. Shamim Ullah, Soumit Pal, Subrata Sarkar.</p>\n<h3>My Words</h3>\n<p>Be polite to others. Be friendly to your Juniors and fellow developers. Try to teach them rather pointing to the mistakes. Attend Meetups. Contribute to the Community. Think what new you have done, and what new can be.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, stay fit with WordPress <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"bangla\">WordPress এবং স্থিতিশীলতা, বাংলা তে পড়ুন</h2>\n<p>WordPress র সাথে পরিচয় ২০০৯ এর December এ, শুরু থেকেই ভালো লাগা.

We care deeply about security, but as an open-source project, our team is mostly comprised of volunteers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Spurlock said that since those guidelines are more pertinent to core, dealing with third-party plugins is a trickier scenario. Ideally, the plugin author would be notified first, so they can work with the plugins team to push updates and remove old versions that may contain those vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress open-source project is always looking for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities,&#8221; Spurlock said. &#8220;We have a process for disclosing for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> and for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">core</a>. Neither of theses processes include posting 0-day exploits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Grillot did not respond to our request for comment, but the company&#8217;s recent blog posts contend that following responsible disclosure in the past would sometimes lead to vulnerabilities being &#8220;covered up,&#8221; and even at times <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cause them to go unfixed</a>.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org support forum moderators do not permit people to report vulnerabilities on the support forums or to engage in discussion regarding vulnerabilities that remain unfixed. The preferred avenue for reporting is to email plugins@wordpress.org so the plugins team can work with authors to patch plugins in a timely way.</p>\n<p>However, in the wild west world of plugins, which includes more than 55,000 hosted on WordPress.org, there are times when responsible disclosure falls apart and occasionally fails users. Responsible disclosure is not a perfect policy, but overall it tends to work better than the alternative. The Plugin Vulnerabilities service even states that they intend to return to responsible disclosure after the protest, essentially recognizing that this policy is the best way to coexist with others in the plugin ecosystem. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, publishing zero-day vulnerabilities exposes sites to potential attacks if the plugin author is not immediately available to write a patch. The only thing WordPress.org can do is remove the plugin temporarily until a fix can be released. This measure protects new users from downloading vulnerable software but does nothing for users who already have the plugin active. If site owners are going to protect themselves by disabling it until there is a fix, they need to know that the plugin is vulnerable. </p>\n<p>Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; controversial protest, which some might even call unethical, may not be the most inspired catalyst for improving WordPress.org&#8217;s approach to security. It is a symptom of a larger issue. WordPress needs strong, visible security leadership and a team with dedicated resources for improving the plugin ecosystem. Plugin authors need a better notification system for advising users of important security updates inside the WordPress admin. Most users are not subscribed to industry blogs and security services &#8211; they depend on WordPress to let them know when an update is important. Refining the infrastructure available to plugin developers and creating a more streamlined security flow is critical for repairing the plugin ecosystem&#8217;s reputation. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 03:37:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: WordCamp for Publishers is Coming to Columbus, OH, August 7-9, Call for Speakers Now Open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88366\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-is-coming-to-columbus-oh-august-7-9-call-for-speakers-now-open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2696:\"<p>The third edition of WordCamp for Publishers will be held in Columbus, OH, August 7-9, 2019, at the <a href=\"https://vuecolumbus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vue Columbus</a>.

The app helps users challenge their &#8220;automatic thoughts,&#8221; a term that refers to thoughts that come to a person spontaneously in response to a trigger, which can often be negative.</p>\n<p>Quirk lets users record a quick thought and will automatically narrow down a list of potential ways these thoughts are distorted. The distortions were inspired by the ones popularized in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UW5X4C/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy</a>. The user is then invited to challenge those distortions and write an alternative thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cZMMRywMDBL\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/5f9Qce5NQW.gif?resize=627%2C667&ssl=1\" alt=\"Quirk demo\" width=\"627\" height=\"667\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Conrad</a>, a software engineer at Segment, created Quirk as a non-commercial, personal project to make it easy for people to take control of their irrational thoughts using a common CBT technique. Quirk is not a substitute for a trained therapist but rather a tool for people to use on their own. Left unchecked, negative automatic thoughts can become emotional weights and lead to distorted thinking. Quirk is a simple app that helps people experience the world in a less negative way and develop more rational thinking patterns. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s super useful for day-to-day stuff,&#8221; Conrad said in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589700\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to comments on Hacker News. &#8220;Take a thought like &#8216;<em>I took too many hints in that interview question</em>.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That thought might lead to <em>&#8216;I must have failed that interview,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll fail all the rest of my interviews,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll never get another job,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I must be really bad at this, I should just give up.&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Each step seemed kind of logical at the time, but one thought led to the next and now you feel awful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CBT is a counter measure to this; it stops you at that first point and gives you a bunch of common logical fallacies that help you recognize why your thought is overreaching. You don’t know if you really flunked that interview, besides flunking one is good practice to pass the next one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad said these types of thought processes aren&#8217;t exactly a mental health issue but are common struggles for many people. Quirk can be a useful tool for anyone looking to recognize and remove their own cognitive biases.</p>\n<p>The iOS version of the app currently works better than the Android one, as the author said he doesn&#8217;t have an Android phone and finds it difficult to support the app on that platform. However, fixes are being pushed out regularly and many of the issues with crashing are getting resolved.</p>\n<h3>How the GPL Protects Users in Mental Health Tech</h3>\n<p>The code for Quirk can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and is open source under the GPL-3.0, which is not a popular choice for licensing mobile apps. I asked Conrad why he opted for the GPL license, as opposed to other popular open source licenses. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Mental Health tech is a really weird world,&#8221; Conrad said. &#8220;There’s a lot of folks who want to do the right thing, but end up doing really sketchy stuff. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, a lot of apps collect the thoughts you’re recording for ML (Machine Learning) or NLP (Natural Language Processing). The stated purpose of this is to help better identify suicide, depression, etc. Partially because of the subject matter, many apps aren’t clearly telling their users that this is happening.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So what ends up happening is a bunch of well intended researchers get access to your most sensitive thoughts. Which is fine, but they frequently aren’t aware of how valuable of a target they’re holding to a nefarious actor. Because it’s not like a database of passwords or credit card numbers, they tend to not think about security. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But thoughts are super valuable and dangerous for abusers and blackmailers; plus most people would rather give you their password in plaintext than show you their mental health thoughts. </p>\n<p>&#8220;So if I made Quirk MIT, I would worry that someone would take Quirk and launch their own version for research that tracks and stores user thoughts. Because the license doesn’t follow them, they could do it without telling a user and there would be little way for an average person to /know/ that this is happening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad has taken an inspiring, user-centric approach to licensing and privacy that ensures users of his app (and any derivatives) will have access to the code and a better understanding of where their data is being stored. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1114575448485191681\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, he outlined the privacy principles that underpin Quirk&#8217;s architecture:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Quirk, FOSS and privacy isn&#8217;t a focus, it&#8217;s a given. Outside the tech world, Quirk is not trying to be a FOSS CBT app, it&#8217;s trying to be a really good CBT app that happens to be FOSS. It&#8217;s not coming out and saying &#8220;hey we don&#8217;t store your deepest darkest secrets on some server somewhere.&#8221; User&#8217;s don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s a given. It doesn&#8217;t store things on the device because it&#8217;s trying to sell you on privacy, it does it because it&#8217;s the correct engineering decision. </p>\n<p>Regular people don&#8217;t look at the Golden Gate bridge and think about the structural quality of the bolts. They pull out their phones and take a picture. The responsibility of software is to make things frictionless and reduce the stuff someone has to think about before buying in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Conrad said he would like to see other developers build things using the app and conduct research, as long as they do so ethically. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a> has a detailed writeup of its design and engineering logic. It includes specific goals the code was built around in order to respect users&#8217; privacy and mental health, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Thoughts are more valuable than passwords, treat them that way.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Be extremely cautious about making engagement your core metric.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>But be clear and obvious within the app about what&#8217;s going on with the user&#8217;s data.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I really do want to see people use Quirk for research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just want it to follow more ethical practices of consent and data security. Someone should willingly give a researcher their thoughts and as little information should be given about the person as possible. When it’s stored, it should be stored safely and not on a publicly exposed DB for example. But for that to happen, it has to be open.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond GPL-specific licensing, making the app open source has many other benefits. Quirk has already been translated into six different languages. One of the byproducts of making a useful app open source is that it energizes contributors and speeds up the process of bringing the app to new audiences. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I cannot express how absolutely amazing it is that Quirk was translated into 6 languages in just a few days. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2665.png\" alt=\"♥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan Conrad (@flaqueEau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1115843899594084352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feedback on the app so far has been mostly positive. One commenter on Hacker News <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589889\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thanked</a> Conrad for open sourcing the app because he wasn&#8217;t able to continue in-person CBT due to the cost:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been through CBT and stopped because of the cost. I feel that an app like this can complement those of us that have had face to face time but stopped for whatever reason.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Quirk is an inspiring example of how open source software can help people with every day problems. Its carefully-considered implementation respects users&#8217; sensitive information and doesn&#8217;t encourage an unhealthy attachment to the app. </p>\n<p>If you like Quirk and want to contribute, you can find the app on <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\">GitHub</a>, including directions for <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk/issues/42#issuecomment-480547963\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">translating it into different languages</a>.

Creator and maintainer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonbahl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Bahl</a> put the project up on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wp-graphql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> last week after people frequently asked how the community can support the project. WPGraphQL already has five backers, an $800 balance, and an estimated annual budget of $2,687.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Large well-known sites such as <a href=\"http://qz.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">qz.com</a> and <a href=\"http://theplayerstribune.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theplayerstribune.com</a> are in production with JavaScript front-ends that consume data from WordPress via WPGraphQL,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;PostLight Studio maintains a popular &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headless WP Starter</a>&#8221; project that initially started as a React + REST API boilerplate, but recently added WPGraphQL support as well.&#8221; </p>\n<p>One of the most important signs of the project&#8217;s growth are the extensions that developers are building on top of it, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ashhitch/wp-graphql-yoast-seo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Yoast SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pristas-peter/wp-graphql-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Gutenberg</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Quartz/wp-graphql-content-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Content Blocks</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields</a> is getting very close to an initial release and Caldera Forms is also <a href=\"https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues/3149\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exploring integrations with WPGraphQL</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The two most-searched things on <a href=\"http://WPGraphQL.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL.com</a> are &#8220;Advanced Custom Fields&#8221; and &#8220;WooCommerce,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;People are interested in using WPGraphQL with other popular WordPress projects, and WPGraphQL for WooCommerce is a reaction to the folks that are already looking for alternatives to the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WPGraphQL for WooCommerce Seeks $15K in Funding</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for WooCommerce</a> is an extension created by Geoffry Taylor that has started to gain some traction. Taylor is a core contributor to the main WPGraphQL plugin. He has just published <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kidunot89/wpgraphql-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Kickstarter to help fund development</a> of the extension and Bahl is consulting with him on implementation details and code reviews. </p>\n<p>Taylor began contributing to the WPGraphQL project last year after discovering the repository and finding that it lacked the features he needed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I was looking for a solution that would allow me to create React-Apollo JS apps that could be used as WordPress themes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the solution couldn&#8217;t rely on a node server, because a large portion of my clients use shared hosting. WPGraphQL was a perfect fit for what I needed, but it lacked the features I needed at the time. This led to me contributing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since then Taylor has also created other libraries and tools that work directly or indirectly with WPGraphQL, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-composer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Composer</a>, a React-Apollo component library, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/oil-based-boilerplate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oil-Based Boilerplate</a>, a boilerplate for developing React-powered WordPress themes, plugins, and guten-blocks that use shared components.</p>\n<p>Taylor is seeking $15K in funding for development of the WPGraphQL WooCommerce extension, which would enable him to apply 100% of his time to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The question I think a lot of people have, is what does this extension provide that WPGraphQL and WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t already?&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;It adds WooCommerce support to the WPGraphQL server. It is being designed to match and increase the functionality of WooCommerce REST to make it as easy as possible to convert your app from the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor said the extension is past the initial explorations and is well into development. If a developer follows the instructions in the README they will be able to query products and their variations, coupons, orders, refunds, customer information, and (after the next update), order items from the WPGraphQL endpoint. He said that with the exception of products, none of the data is queryable for any user without shop-manager level capabilities. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Customer-level functionality is the target goal right now, meaning customers can register/login, update the cart, and checkout,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested can follow the project&#8217;s progress on <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> or get involved on Slack at <a href=\"http://wp-graphql.slack.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wp-graphql.slack.com</a> in the #woocommerce channel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:49:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordSesh Returns May 22, 2019, Speaker Application Deadline is April 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-returns-may-22-2019-speaker-application-deadline-is-april-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1978:\"<p>The next edition of <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordSesh</a> is scheduled for Wednesday, May 22, 2019, from 10am-8pm EDT (UTC-4) &#8211; just a little over one month away.

Some even felt blindsided by the original implementation. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Last week, the release candidate was running on my staging server, and out of nowhere, I noticed these ads being inserted inline with the rest of the WC admin list tables,&#8221; Tobin Fekkes said. &#8220;What a shock that was! I thought I’d developed a bad case of malware or something. What nasty plugin was corrupting my core, default products table, order table, etc?! Oh, just core WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have never once gone looking to add a plugin to my site by starting at the &#8216;Products&#8217; tab. Because it doesn’t belong there. If I want to install an extension or plugin, I will go to the (aptly named) &#8216;Extensions&#8217; tab or “Plugins” tab.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is rather telling that we as longtime developers who attend every Dev chat, bookmark and check this Dev blog daily, and test all your betas and release candidates STILL had no idea about this blatant abuse of trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce, addressed the issue of marketplace suggestions seeming to come out of nowhere in a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-6-to-add-marketplace-suggestions-despite-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-from-developer-community#comment-285682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on our recent post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are committed to working with our community, including the plugin review team, and responding to feedback. Just as a reminder, the Marketplace Suggestions feature was developed in the open in a long-running feature branch/PR which was merged to master a month ago. It was mentioned in the Beta 1 Release notes, and was testable during Beta1 and prior on master.</p>\n<p>It is often only when the release candidate comes out that we get certain kinds of feedback. It’s an important stage in the development cycle when we want and expect input. With the 3.6 RC1 live, we received specific feedback that we could take into consideration and act on. Thanks to the developers, end users, and the plugin review team for all their help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.6 RC2 doesn&#8217;t make any changes to the frequency with which users will need to dismiss the ads. Some have commented that it is more like &#8220;snoozing&#8221; the ads, since they require dismissal every day for five days, only to return every month thereafter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We continue to be in contact with the plugin review team to ensure the suggestions are in accordance with the guidelines,&#8221; Wilkens said. &#8220;There is a live conversation on the definition of suggestion/advert dismissibility. We will participate in that conversation and honor the outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As this implementation of marketplace suggestions still is not satisfactory to many WooCommerce users and developers, a plugin for turning off has already been submitted and approved in the WordPress plugin directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/surbma-woocommerce-without-marketplace-suggestions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Without Marketplace Suggestions</a> removes the suggestions permanently without users having to continually dismiss them. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:18:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"HeroPress: Firefighter to Web Developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2735\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:130:\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=firefighter-to-web-developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13123:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041019-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I wouldn\'t be anything without the help of those around me.\" /><p>I’m jolted awake to the sound of the tones going off in my room. I knew that I hadn’t been asleep long because we’d already run a late call and it was still dark outside. Running to the truck, I hear the address come out over the radio for a medical call. It’s the third time this week we’ve been called to the same house.</p>\n<p>My driving is on autopilot because I know the city streets like the back of my hand. Not only had I worked in the same fire department for the last 6 years, but I’d also grown up in this city. On this and many other times I’d been woken up in the middle of the night, I’m starting to realize that I’m losing my passion for the job I once loved.</p>\n<h3>How I Got Into Firefighting</h3>\n<p>At 19 years old I was working in fast food, and I knew I needed to do something more with my life. I wasn’t really keen on going to college just yet, so I started looking for jobs that only needed vocational school. Knowing that I wouldn’t be a very good police officer, I signed up for fire school.</p>\n<p>During fire school I found the only way to get a job as a firefighter in Florida was to also be an EMT in order to run medical calls, so I enrolled in there as well. While I was in school, one of the instructors I met told me their department was taking on volunteers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Six years in the field, a year of paramedic school, and many sleepless nights later, I’m driving to a call feeling trapped in a career that I don’t care for anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the perks of being a firefighter is that in between calls the free time is ours to do what we like, we just need to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice. Some of the time we watch movies and play video games, but I wanted that time to do something productive that I could turn into an opportunity for a side gig.</p>\n<h3>Why I Chose Web Developer</h3>\n<p>I stumbled across a YouTube video that demonstrated how to create a webpage with HTML. I loaded a page that stereotypically read “Hello World” and I was hooked. I didn’t even own a computer at this time in my life, but my wife had a MacBook Air. She was nice enough to let me borrow it so I could keep learning. Downloading a text editor, I started creating web pages and loading them up in a browser. Though, as I was creating these pages, it was pretty obvious there weren&#8217;t any live websites out there that looked as bad as what I was creating.</p>\n<p>While going through YouTube looking for more tutorials, I kept seeing videos for this thing called WordPress in the sidebar. Curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on one of the videos. I saw how pages were being created from an admin background and how themes changed the look of sites, while plugins added functionality. I was completely blown away.</p>\n<p>By this time, I had purchased a $250 Chromebook I was running Linux from, and I decided that I was going to run a local development environment on this little computer with a 16GB hard drive. I managed to succeed, and with each accomplishment I had, I found that I was becoming extremely passionate about building these little websites.</p>\n<h3>Meeting Other Humans</h3>\n<p>I knew that I wasn’t going to make it very far past the beginning stages without help from someone other than a search engine. Though without any knowledge of the community and how they would act towards me, going to a local meetup was something that made me very uncomfortable. I thought the second they caught a glimpse of my Chromebook and my silly beginner questions they’d have me out the door before I could sit down.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even in the parking lot before my first meetup, I was sitting in my car telling myself that I should just drive home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I walked into the meetup I was surprised to find people in all stages of their growth with WordPress. There were even people that knew less than me, and they were accepted just as much as I was. It was there I learned about this event called a WordCamp. I knew that whatever it was, I needed to be there and it was only two months away.</p>\n<h3>First WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Sitting in my car in front of my first WordCamp Orlando, I felt the same feelings that I did before my first meetup. I reminded myself how welcoming the meetup was, and that this wasn’t going to be any different. When I grabbed my seat in the main auditorium, I started feeling pretty strongly that I was alone in a room of 300 people. There were business owners that could actually make money off WordPress, and it felt that there weren’t many people at my experience level. As I went from talk to talk, the topics flew over my head and I became very overwhelmed. I told myself that I was going to stick it out till lunch and that I could go home after if I wanted.</p>\n<p>Lunch came and as I was walking around looking for a good place to sit, I noticed a familiar face sitting at a table with no one next to him. Up until now, I had been learning exclusively at Lynda.com and Treehouse. I was learning to use the Genesis Framework and took a couple courses by an instructor named <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/freed-from-the-soil-lab/\">Jesse Petersen</a>, and this guy looked just like him. Walking up next to him I said: “I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but you look just like an instructor I learned from on Treehouse.” He laughed and said that he was indeed that instructor from Treehouse.</p>\n<p>The pitch of my voice shot up an octave, and I started fanning out over how I had learned so much from him and asked if I could eat with him. While we ate, I told him that I was a firefighter and how I also wanted to become a web developer and build websites. By the end of the lunch, he told me that he saw something in me and that he wanted to mentor me if I was ok with that. Was I ok with that?!? Of course, I was ok with that! I was doing my best to sound cool all the while I’m absolutely ecstatic on the inside.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day I followed him around to talks, and while I was listening, he was setting up my computer with tools to help get me set up for further development. He added me to his Slack channel and told me that we were going to be working together remotely. When the day finished he asked me where we were having dinner in between the last session and the after-party.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve never gone from feeling so out of place somewhere to then feeling so welcomed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was talking to a person that had absolutely no gain from helping me out, yet spent the entirety of his day getting me set up to work with him in the future.</p>\n<p>Jesse wasn’t feeling well the next day due to an illness he had called Cystic Fibrosis. He said that he would keep up with me through the day on Slack though. Whenever I felt like I didn’t belong I would look at the tools Jesse had installed on my computer and the Slack channel and would remember that I was welcome. I was going to be learning some awesome stuff, and now I had a mentor.</p>\n<h3>Gettin&#8217; Paid</h3>\n<p>I spent the next few months going to two other WordCamps learning as much as I could and meeting as many people as possible. After going down to WordCamp Miami, I got approached by a local agency owner at a meetup that had some extra work I could help out with. Little did I know, they were also friends with Jesse and he had told them about me and what I’d been learning. This gave me a chance to get my feet wet and build some very strong friendships with some amazing people. I was now making money doing what I loved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four months later I got a Slack message from one of my friends telling me that Jesse had passed away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was on shift at the fire department that day, and I felt like someone had hit me with a bat. He was due to get new lungs any time, and just the day before was telling me how he was going to start a new life once he had the strength of new lungs to do so. We were all crushed to hear of his passing. I knew it was going to be hard moving forward without him, but I knew that’s what he would have wanted.</p>\n<h3>Keynote Presentation</h3>\n<p>I continued working on my skills until I was asked to do a keynote presentation at WordCamp Orlando. The very WordCamp I’d thought about leaving halfway through just a year before. The owner of the agency I was working for, Chris Edwards, told me they’d had a speaker back out and they needed someone to fill in, so they asked <i>me</i>. They wanted me to tell my story of how I had gotten into the WordPress community. I agreed, believing it was only going to a small room full of people, but when I said yes, I was then told I would be giving the opening keynote address in front of the entire WordCamp. I had already said yes, so now there was no way that I could back down and tell him no.</p>\n<p>As I was standing on stage waiting to be introduced, I was relieved to find there was a podium. Now no one could see my legs shaking as I stood there for an hour. I could now put all my focus on making sure the hand holding the microphone stayed steady. My talk was on the past year that had led me to this point and all of the fears and vulnerabilities I’d faced. If there was someone that was feeling the way I had a year ago, I wanted them to know that they were welcome and I was excited to have them there.</p>\n<h3>Leaving the Fire Service</h3>\n<p>The rest of the weekend passed, and I got a message from my friend Chris Edwards telling me that a company that makes a donation plugin called Give was looking for a support technician. Matt Cromwell, who was about to be my new boss, was sitting in the audience while I gave my keynote presentation. I filled out the application and got a response back that he wanted to set up an interview.</p>\n<p>A year has passed since that time, and I’ve grown so much in my knowledge of web development, website management, and WordPress. I’ve just started my first business as a freelance WordPress developer, and again I’m feeling the same fears, excitement, and vulnerabilities I felt every time I started to push myself. It’s now to the point where I almost keep a lookout for the fear because I know that something amazing is going to happen on the other side.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m always going to remember the compassion that Jesse Petersen had for me, and remember to pay that kindness forward in helping others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s no way I could have planned this path for myself even if I’d tried. I know that I’m in the right place now, because every day I wake up I’m happy that I get to work with WordPress and interact with this awesome community. I wouldn’t be anything without the help of those around me, and I will always be grateful for everything they’ve done.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Firefighter to Web Developer\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Firefighter%20to%20Web%20Developer&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Firefighter to Web Developer\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F&title=Firefighter+to+Web+Developer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041019-min-150x150.jpg&description=Firefighter to Web Developer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/\" title=\"Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/\">Firefighter to Web Developer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 12:00:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Sam Smith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: GoDaddy Acquires ThemeBeans, CoBlocks, Block Gallery, and Block Unit Tests\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4970:\"<p>GoDaddy has acquired <a href=\"https://coblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a>, <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeBeans</a>, <a href=\"https://wpblockgallery.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Gallery</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-unit-test\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Unit Tests</a>, one of the leading Gutenberg product lines in the WordPress ecosystem.

It&#8217;s a thing we&#8217;re learning in this new post-Gutenberg world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he was surprised that his products had attracted GoDaddy&#8217;s interest but also found it to be validating of his own efforts and the potential of the block editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Throughout my time building themes, and then blocks, I’ve learned the real value of getting eyes on a project: Not only do you get the community rallying behind your ideas, such as the Block Manager recently added in Gutenberg 5.3, but you receive a TON of feedback and inspiration,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;Building on that feedback, consistently delivering clever ideas, and executing on the marketing front with inspiring videos, has landed us in a very opportune position.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy has acquired a handful of WordPress companies and services during the past few years (ManageWP, Sucuri, WP Curve), but Tabor&#8217;s products are the first Gutenberg-related acquisition for the company. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it means that the WordPress ecosystem is important, that it’s maturing, and probably most of all &#8211; that it’s moving and changing,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I think all of those are good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has changed a lot in WordPress. It’s not just a new editor or new interface, it’s a whole new system that brings with it a whole new group of challenges. Companies like GoDaddy recognizing this and supporting innovation is a healthy sign of growth and maturity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s resources will enable CoBlocks, ThemeBeans, and Block Gallery to move faster and add features that were previously out of reach for Tabor&#8217;s small team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ll go from just two developers, to a team of incredibly bright engineers,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I won’t be spending time figuring out all the intricacies of monetizing a premium plugin in today’s ever-changing WordPress ecosystem. Instead, I can focus on leading the team’s efforts on bringing a better page building experience to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He will also have access to insights and data that will enable his team to make more informed decisions about the tools and blocks they build.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This view into how entrepreneurs and business owners are using WordPress is something I could never have achieved at a meaningful scale, and I know it will help me move more confidently in the future landscape of Gutenberg,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 04:15:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6874\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3882:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

That is, themes and plugins that use public widget APIs must remain functional.</li>\n<li>During a transition period, it should be possible to disable the block-based interface and return to the classic widget-editing interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The requirements for backwards compatibility are a tall order but will make it much easier for users to trust WordPress during this transition. Content will not be forced into the new interface and users will retain the option to use the classic widget-editing screen if they prefer. The team has not yet announced a date for when widgets will be officially deprecated. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-3rd-april/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg version 5.4</a> was released last week with vertical alignment support for the columns block, a playsInline option in the video block, and a number of other minor enhancements.
